    <title>Lent – why I’m never gonna give you up</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://theurbanpastor.wordpress.com/2017/03/05/lent-why-im-never-gonna-give-you-up/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>It’s <a href="https://twitter.com/ChrchCurmudgeon/status/837016471863635969/photo/1">Lent</a>. Started last Wednesday. The Prime Minister, Theresa May, is providing a strong lead and giving up crisps. Salt and vinegar being her weakness. So, I’m guessing the thought of giving something up for the next forty days has crossed your mind. Because that’s what Lent’s about, right? Honestly, I have very little idea what Lent is about. I’ve never been very good at paying attention to things that hold no interest for me. Don’t get me wrong, I’m really interested in Jesus’ death and his resurrection. But no so much the religiously inserted rigmarole that so often accompanies it in church tradition. After all, the Bible doesn’t talk about Lent. And so, it can’t be that important. It’s certainly not crucial to our Christian life. It might be useful but it’s not essential. We don’t have to observe it. A younger version of me would have railed against the imposition of any perceived religious ritual and flaunted my freedom in the gospel to ignore something I assumed was the re-imposition of Roman Catholicism. Aren’t you glad you didn’t know me at university?! There are valuable things that are part and parcel of Lent; meditation – by which I mean the prayerful consideration of the scriptures, perhaps especially focussing on the death of Christ and fasting. Fasting has value. But neither of those things need to be limited to this time of year. And neither of them is compulsory. So let’s keep this thing in perspective.</p>
<p>The single most important thing about Lent is freedom. You’re free to observe it if you want. And you’re free not to. It’s your call. But you don’t have to. Whether it’s a good thing for us to observe will likely be determined by what’s going on in our hearts. If you do please don’t look down on those of us that decide not to join you. Don’t judge us or condemn us. Don’t think you’re better or superior than us and that somehow you’ve attained a higher spiritual state. You haven’t. And be careful not to use your freedom to give it a go to lead a weaker brother into sin and cause them stumble. There may be some among us who’ve been saved from a Roman Catholic background who are constantly tempted back to putting our confidence in our fleshly observance of the religious traditions from which Christ came to set us free. Having you press that onto our conscience won’t help us to trust Christ alone for our salvation. Of course, if you don’t observe any Lenten habits then please don’t assume that those of us who do have turned Catholic. We probably haven’t. We probably just recognise the value of some of these things for our own Christians lives and that this time of year has provided the much-needed stimulus to arouse us from our spiritual lethargy and actually employ God’s means of grace. Obviously, I think there’s some value in observing Lent. But I’m not planning to. I’m just going to keep ploughing on with the same old, same old. Not because I can’t be improved upon. I can. And I probably should. But I don’t have to. So, I’m not going to. Not this time, it’s crept up on me unawares and I haven’t really prepared anything for it. But that’s OK because Christ’s death is all about forgiveness.</p>

It’s worth a read if you can get behind their pay wall. Apparently the English Cricket Board (ECB) has enlisted the help of an ex-Army Officer now Management Consultant, Gemma Morgan to help them develop new leaders.</p>
<p>In doing so, they assess potential leadership candidates in four areas;</p>
<ol>
<li>their impact within a group,</li>
<li>their ability to make things happen,</li>
<li>their interpersonal skills and</li>
<li>their thinking skills.</li>
</ol>
<p>That’s not surprising. It’s what you might expect. But what’s striking in the article is her insistence on character being key. The overriding message at the Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst is that leadership is service. Their motto ‘serve to lead’ is everywhere. Now that’s remarkable. It’s almost the polar opposite of how things ordinarily work in the world of sport. Normally captaincy is about having ‘runs on the board’. As  Morgan, an ex-international lacrosse player, observes,</p>
<blockquote><p>‘Coming from the sports field initially this turned leadership on its head for me, because until then I understood leadership as hero-based: am I the best player, the leading goal scorer, the go-to player that kind of thing’.</p></blockquote>
<p>Many of us in church planting and  pastoring resonate with that kind of thinking. But our competencies have to do with preaching, evangelistic effectiveness, theological knowledge and strategic thinking and so on. But, she goes on,</p>
<blockquote><p>‘At Sandhurst I came to understand that it was not about me but about duty and service to others. It opened my eyes. Before they teach you any technical stuff, they underpin everything with values that are uncompromising. Integrity, for example, if you breach integrity you’re gone and you won’t be invited back. Once you’ve got these anchors in place, they add on the technical bits. In sport and business it is the other way around. In the army, they will not take a risk on character’.</p></blockquote>
<p>In recent months, the England One Day Captain Eoin Morgan decided not to tour Bangladesh citing security risks as his issue. He copped a fair amount of flak for that. This was interpreted as a leader choosing to abandon his men when faced with hardship. It looked self-interested. It may not have been if he was making that decision in such a way that it gave implicit permission for others to follow suit. Interestingly Alex Hales decided not to tour as well. When pushed for her verdict on this decision Gemma Morgan would not be drawn because she simply didn’t know the rationale and motive behind Eoin Morgan’s decision. But she did say this, ‘You have to lead by example and my experience is that people will follow if you think you have their best interests at heart’.</p>
<p>It turns out that leadership is not so much about having ‘runs on the board’. And England’s own history bears that out because one of the most respected and most successful Captains was a man who arguably wasn’t good enough to get in the 2<sup>nd</sup> XI. He was the man who got the best out of Bob Willis and Ian Botham in the 1981 Ashes series. His name is Mike Brierley and he’s written a book called ‘The Art of Captaincy’. It’s on my Amazon wish list!</p>
<p>For those of us who suffer under the delusion that we might still be the hero every church needs, Morgan did close with this encouragement,</p>
<blockquote><p>‘There is a time for autocratic and direct leadership but to get people to follow unquestioningly you have to have invested a lot of time in the relationships. If you’re selfish you will get found out. If you get a combination of a brilliant player, a charismatic leader, and someone with the interests of others at heart? Then, great. But they don’t come along very often’.</p></blockquote>
<p>The odds are that most ofus are not in that category. And neither are our leaders. And so character really matters. And self sacrificial service is paramount. Who’d have thought it?!</p>
<p>In Mark’s Gospel Chapter 10 verse 45, we read this, ‘the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve and to give his life as a ransom for many’. That’s leadership. And it’s runs on the board. Just in a different kind of a way.</p>

Before he got me up to preach, Matt Fuller got me up to be interviewed. I hate thinking on my feet almost as much as I hate realising afterwards what I should have said. And so Matt warned me what he was going to ask, which gave me a few moments to formulate a useful answer. He asked me what the benefits of belonging to a network of churches were.</p>
<p>That’s a bit like asking what are the benefits of belonging to a family. It all depends on your experience of family. And for the record (in case my Mother ever reads this) my experience of my actual family has been uniformly wonderful. And in case the Director of Co-Mission ever reads this, my experience of my metaphorical family has been similarly positive.</p>
<p>But I think the family metaphor works. I like it that we’re (<a href="http://www.christchurchbalham.org.uk/">CCB</a>) a part of a family of churches; a network of like-minded congregations trying to help one another do the same thing. For my money there are three obvious benefits that we’ve experienced in the last 14 years.</p>
<p><strong>1. Co-Mission has provided us with a network of relationships</strong>. In my wider family I have aunts and uncles, brothers and sisters, nephews and nieces and so on. It’s good for me to have so many different people in my life like that. It’s relationally rich.  But there are a lot of lonely Ministers out there and a lot of isolated churches. But that’s never been true of me or CCB. We’ve always belonged, partly because we were the first plant from Dundonald in 2002 and they looked after us. But that’s what happens in families. Those of us on the staff and the ministry trainees experience the relational aspect perhaps more than most because we’re involved in training together with others in Co-Mission. Those relationships are so helpful in terms of personal support, ministry encouragement and godly challenge. And the elders of our churches are part of the Co-Mission Partnership and we meet together several times throughout the year as we reflect on and prepare for our joint ministry activity. And wonderfully because of things like <a href="https://co-mission.org/events/revive/">Revive</a>, or the forthcoming <a href="https://co-mission.org/events/co-mission-womens-day/">Co-Mission Women’s Day</a> or Children’s Ministry training there are ample opportunities for congregational members to support one another in other churches. It’s been our great privilege to receive people over the years from other Co-Mission congregations who know what they’re going to get with us and want to remain part of the Co-Mission family. And we’ve been able to send people off to other Co-Mission churches to serve there. And the odds are that they already know people when they get there. It’s so encouraging to be part of a family of churches.</p>
<p><strong>2. Co-Mission has provided us with a wealth of resources</strong>. When we were planted we were like the typical teenage kid going off to university or married couple starting out together. We were sent with our hands full of everything that we might need for those early days. We had people, we had finance and we had training and support. There’s no way that we could have got going on our own. It just wouldn’t have happened because we didn’t have what we needed on our own. But wonderfully we didn’t need to have it all because others in the wider Co-Mission family (not that it was called that then because it didn’t formally come into existence till 2005) wanted to be generous and share their resources to help get us off the ground. We continue to share the resources God has entrusted to us. New church plants benefit from people sent from other churches. Money moves from one church account into another in order to finance a worker or two in an economically deprived area. And we share training because there’s diversity of gospel ministers in Co-Mission; men and women with different expertise and experience. And at things like the Ministry Training Workshop everyone benefits. We’ve tried to be intentional about resource rich congregations supporting resource poor congregations, especially in the early days of planting and especially if (humanly speaking) there’s likelihood of some of those ministries ever being self-sufficient. That tends to happen through local geographical clusters. And it’s a good thing to be generous and sacrificial as we steward the resources that God has entrusted to us.</p>
<p><strong>3. Co-Mission has provided us with a reminder of our responsibilities</strong>. The issues of training people for ministry, reaching the lost with the gospel and planting churches are rarely off the agenda in this family of churches. It’s really helpful to be reminded of our responsibilities as churches. When teenagers grow up they have to accept that with great privilege comes great responsibility. I’m not sure we would have planted <a href="http://streathamcentralchurch.org.uk/">Streatham Central</a>, contemplated training up Jay as a church planter and encouraged <a href="http://www.bloc.london/">BLoC</a> to hibernate with us without being part of a family that regularly reminded one another that we’re trying to reach London for Christ through pioneering church planting. There’s a great danger in our personal lives to strive for, succeed and then settle for comfort. And that’s no different in our churches. But being part of a church family where we’re often talking about planting, about places without a gospel witness and about areas of London that aren’t being reached means that there’s a godly dissatisfaction that drives us on. We’re not happy to settle for comfort because even if we’re going well in our patch, 90% of London doesn’t believe the gospel. That’s a lot of people. And so, even if any of us runs a numerically successful ministry, we’re barely scratching the surface in this great city. Theer’s work to be done. And we have responsibilities. I love being part of a network that keeps reminding us of that.</p>
<p>Co-Mission isn’t the best family. I’m not saying that. But it’s ours. And I’m really grateful for it. It’s helped us be church. And it’s helped me serve church. There are real benefits to our network. And I praise God for it.</p>

Am I right? I hadn’t until I read Chris Boardman’s autobiography over Christmas. They were stalwart members of a group of volunteers at the Kirkby Stadium, a cycling velodrome near the Wirral (<a href="http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/other-sport/cycling-farewell-to-kirkby-track-3506902">now closed down</a>). It’s where Boardman learnt to compete. He went on to become very accomplished at going round in circles very quickly.</p>
<p>You can trace the contemporary supremacy of British Cyclists and the growing popularity of recreational cycling to this man. He won individual pursuit gold at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics. He was the first man in the Yellow Jersey at the Tour de France since Tom Simpson in the early 1960s. After him came the household names of Bradley Wiggins, Sarah Storey, Chris Froome, Laura Kenny (nee Trott), Chris Hoy, Victoria Pendleton, Jason Kenny and may others. Boardman is partly responsible for the success of British Cycling, having worked quietly behind the scenes fuelling the research and development to give cyclists a technical edge as well as implementing recruitment systems and training processes and raising up and developing coaches. He’s responsible for the affordable range of bikes that bear his name sold at high street retailer Halfords. They’re very, very good bikes evidenced by the fact that the Brownlee brothers, Alastair and Jonathan, use them in triathlon. And Boardman has become an outspoken advocate and vocal campaigner for the social benefits of cycling.</p>
<p>But without John, Doreen, Ginger or John none of this would have happened. And Boardman knows it. They are the unsung heroes so beloved by Sports Personality of the Year. It’s the bit in the show that makes me well up. That phenomenon causes extreme embarrassment to my children and great amusement to my wife. But for me it’s fast becoming the sole reason to sit through SPOTY. But that’s a gripe for another day. But hear what Chris Boardman has to say about these volunteers,</p>
<blockquote><p>‘Just a handful of individuals presiding over a low key activity on the outskirts of Liverpool helping people take their firsts steps in the sport. What they didn’t realise was that they were the true pioneers of the Olympic success to come, quietly preparing the ground for Britain’s cycling revolution’.</p></blockquote>
<p>I couldn’t help but spot some parallels with our own situation at <a href="http://www.christchurchbalham.org.uk">CCB</a>. Nearly fifteen years ago people like Gordon, Phoebe, Christian, Helen, Jenni, Rosslyn and Rufus were part of small group of twenty who were planted into Balham to start a new church. None of us imagined that we’d be where we are now. It’s a wonderful work of God’s grace. I’m not going to claim that we were quietly preparing the ground for London’s evangelical revolution. But it’s great testimony to God’s goodness that he’s caused us to grow, enabled us to plant both <a href="http://streathamcentralchurch.org.uk/">Streatham Central Church</a> (SCC) and <a href="http://www.bloc.london/">Brixton Local Church</a> (BLoC) and participated in the training of individuals for full time gospel ministry. That’s not nothing. At my last count we’d trained twelve people as ministry apprentices. And we have three currently ‘in the system’. That’s an average of one per year. I think we can and should do more. But that’s also for another time. And we haven’t even mentioned the conversion of individuals wo’ve come to trust in Christ, people who’ve been maintained in their faith, who’ve have grown in maturity and been equipped for the works of service that God has prepared for them to carry out in their homes, among their friends, at work and in the community.</p>
<p>I suspect that few of us in churches think much about what our participation in our local church will produce. We’re pretty short sighted. Church is part of the routine of life. Like work on a Monday morning. But take heart. Lift your eyes to the future. It is your very great privilege to be a participant in a divinely instituted organisation through whom God is building something significant for the future. One day we will be able to trace the value of our contribution into eternity. And it’ll be amazing to see how God has sued what we’ve down as He brings all things together under the saving reign of His Son, Jesus Christ. And in all likelihood we’ll probably even now have some inkling of what He’s doing in the present. But many of us don’t feel that we’re doing anything that important. Our name might appear regularly on a rota. We might be part of a team that runs a small ministry. But what we do just keeps things ticking along and the show on the road. But presumably that’s what the Mallinsons, Ginger and John thought.</p>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 15:58 the Apostle Paul wrote this, ‘Always give yourself fully to the work of the Lord, because you know that your labour in the Lord is not in vain’. None of it is wasted. It all counts. The Lord will see to that. And who knows, your church may be somewhere from where the evangelical equivalent of a Chris Boardman develops!</p>

<p>In 2002 Chris Boardman sat down in the canteen of the Manchester Velodrome with the British Cycling Head Endurance Coach Simon Jones and a talented but frustrated cyclist on the brink of throwing in the towel. His name was Bradley Wiggins.</p>
<p>Chris Boardman was someone who’d done it before. To steal a cricketing metaphor, he had runs on the board. He was an Olympic champion and a two time wearer of the Tour de France Yellow Jersey. The idea was that Wiggins might be willing to listen to someone who’d known success.</p>
<p>In that canteen Boardman simply asked Wiggins three questions.</p>
<p>1.    What do you want to achieve?<br/>
2.    What do you think that requires?<br/>
3.    How does what you’re planning get you those things?</p>
<p>Those are three great questions. It won’t surprise many to learn that as I read Boardman’s autobiography over the Christmas period, my arm instinctively reached for the notebook and pen. These questions are not entirely unfamiliar to those of us in the <a href="http://www.theantiochplan.org.uk/">Antioch Plan</a>, at least in broad outline. They’re scratching at the issues of vision, strategy and tactics. I’ve already warned the Antioch Planters that I may be quoting liberally from this book in the coming term. The man who was the vanguard of Britain’s cycling revolution may unwittingly be contributing to the coaching of our church planters!</p>
<p>But think briefly about those three questions for a moment in the context of church growth.</p>
<p><strong>What do you want to achieve?</strong> I imagine the answer of our planters will be a variation on something like this, ‘I want to see the establishment of a flourishing church plant that’s heading towards sustainability as people hear the gospel, place their trust in Christ, grow in their knowledge and understanding of God’s word and use their ability, opportunity and capacity to bring about the growth of his kingdom in our local context’. Their version of that answer will be better.</p>
<p><strong>What do you think that requires?</strong> Again, I imagine they’ll answer something like this, ‘It’ll take servant leadership from me and other leaders and it’ll require sacrificial participation from everyone in the church plant. Everyone will need to be involved in reaching our neighbours with the gospel, providing a church family for them to belong and training one another so that we grow in our biblical convictions, our godly character and our ministry competency’.</p>
<p><strong>How does what you’re planning get you those things?</strong> If what they’re planning is an aggressive door knocking strategy, and by that I don’t mean door knocking in an aggressive manner (one would assume that would be counter-productive) but instead a determined and insistent approach to making sure that everyone in your neighbourhood has the opportunity to know of your church plant’s existence and pursue any line of spiritual enquiry that they might have, then they need to be able to examine the wisdom of said tactic especially as it comes under sceptical scrutiny from those they’re trying to persuade them in such a venture! For the record, I think it’s hard to think of reasons why our planters wouldn’t do this. It’s a good tactic, though not without potential cost.</p>
<p>As you’ll no doubt know, Wiggins went on to notable success, even if his efforts on the road are currently under some suspicion since they were accomplished with the addition of permissible but lamentable medical assistance. For those who are not following the story, Wiggins applied for and received a Therapeutic Use Exemption (TUE) that allowed him to receive medication for a pre-existing medical issue. That medication also probably helped him go further and faster. For my money that’s the kind of thing that Paul has in mind in 2 Timothy 2 when he talks about the athlete receiving the victor’s crown competing according to the rules. Wiggins may have received a crown but only he knows whether he really competed according to the rules. But what’s more interesting to me than Bradley’s dodgoire TUE is that at that moment in 2002 in a canteen in Manchester, he didn’t quit. The conversation and the probing questions kept him in the game.</p>
<p>In the book Boardman reflected on that exchange and Wiggins’ subsequent response. The initial answers he gave were vague and unconvincing. And so Boardman sent him away and told him to e-mail him a plan once he’d thought it through. Wiggins did that a week later. But what convinced Boardman that Wiggins was now serious were his responses when pressed. Boardman writes, ‘I wasn’t directly critical, never said what was right and wrong, but I did drill down into his reasoning, asking him to explain what made him believe each particular step of his plan would work. What were his beliefs based on? How would he measure progress? Where he waffled and evaded I demanded evidence and clarity’. You might imagine that Boardman would make a persistent but productive church planting coach. But if you were planting a church you’d be glad of that kind of input, wouldn’t you? If you could survive that type of questioning you’d be certain that you were on the right path. That only leaves doing what you’ve planned to concentrate on!</p>
<p>It seems to me, to plan for success, our church planters and church pastors need to be willing to put our church growth plans under the same degree of scrutiny. We’ve got to have answers to those questions. God may give growth irrespective of how well we’re thought through. But it’ll be accidental. And we’ll take that, of course! But how much better to be deliberate? And plan. After all, are we not encouraged to anticipate that the Lord will work through means rather than despite them?</p>

    <title type="text">Things We Argue About</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Driving down to Bristol for sister's wedding. We pass an estate agents window which has little model houses in the window like at Bekenscot.&lt;br&gt;Me: Laura, look at the cute little houses. Which one would you live in?&lt;br&gt;Laura: I can't really see them.&lt;br&gt;Me: I like the white one best, but the green one has bigger windows.&lt;br&gt;Laura: oh those houses. I thought you meant the houses they were advertising in the window. I was wondering how you could possibly see them.&lt;br&gt;Chris: I thought you meant the ones in the photos.&lt;br&gt;Alice: so did I.&lt;br&gt;Me: how could I possibly have seen the ones in the photographs? What, have I suddenly developed super eyesight?&lt;br&gt;Chris: that's what I thought. So I thought you must be talking just for the sake of saying something.&lt;br&gt;Me: when do I ever do that?&lt;br&gt;Chris: exactly. So I thought you must have gone mad.&lt;br&gt;Me: so you'd rather ignore everything you know about me and assume that I'd gone mad, rather than entertain the possibility that I might have been talking about the cute little model houses, which only that estate agent has, rather than the photos of houses, which every estate agent has?&lt;br&gt;Chris: I didn't think they were cute.&lt;br&gt;Me: surely it's more plausible that I meant the model houses but that what I think is cute is different from what you think is cute, rather than that I'd suddenly developed super eyesight and also lost my mind?&lt;br&gt;Chris: your position is indefensible&lt;br&gt;Me: my position is defensible. I am defending it, unfortunately I appear to be dealing with a bunch of dopes&lt;br&gt;Laura: we can't all be dopes&lt;br&gt;Me: well, apparently you can&lt;br&gt;Laura: the families in cars in adverts are never like &lt;u&gt;this&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title type="text">Fall Out Boy</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;I'm in the grip of several slow-burning obsessions at the moment. Fall Out Boy, for one, I'm sort of crushing on them collectively. What a difference a live gig makes! It's hard to say why as most of the time you had to watch them on the big screens (and why is that different from watching them on YouTube?), but that is the mystery of human presence. Being there, in the same air as people, makes a difference. Why? Maybe they seem more real. Maybe you see everything, not just what the cameraman directs you to see, which helps to fill in the reality of someone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Then I've started my new Elena Ferrante book. I wonder if a Lila really existed, or if the author is simply applying herself into two and writing about both halves. I wish I could get the girls to read it: it's such an eye-opening validating piece of work, especially for women. Some woman in the paper was worrying that it wasn&amp;#8217;t really literature. Why? Why not? What is&lt;br&gt;unliterary about it? The fact that it&amp;#8217;s enjoyable? The fact that it acts as&lt;br&gt;though what two young girls in Naples in &lt;u&gt;mid-twentieth&lt;/u&gt; century thought or&lt;br&gt;felt is important? I don&amp;#8217;t see how you could find a book more serious intelligent and authentic than these novels are turning out to be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;On a more trivial note, I've been reading about Kate Moss&amp;#8217; new squeeze in the Telegraph: Nikolai von Bismarck, who from a quick piece of deductive work via Wikipedia, must be the second nephew of Gottfried von Bismarck (the first cousin of Nikolai&amp;#8217;s father Leopold, who was the younger brother of Gottfried&amp;#8217;s father, the&lt;br&gt;Prince von Bismarck). I knew Gottfried from Oxford when we were both in a&lt;br&gt;Ionesco play, The Lesson, being directed by an acquaintance from New College. I didn&amp;#8217;t really know Gottfried, what with him being such a posho, but he seemed perfectly nice. He moved with the Olivia Channon set and died himself a few years ago, essentially from his lifestyle (drugs, gay orgies etc). All rather sad: gilded youth! This was all post the ITV Brideshead craze. Little did I think, as I was living through it, that people would be looking back at the eighties in a haze of nostalgia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;At lunch I went out and bought some Vichy Aqualia Thermal Serum because it&lt;br&gt;was on a Guardian list of best skincare products and I&amp;#8217;m running out of&lt;br&gt;face cream. I don&amp;#8217;t even know how to use it! It was &amp;#163;5 off. I wonder if it&lt;br&gt;will have any detectible effect on my skin, that wouldn&amp;#8217;t be just as well&lt;br&gt;achieved with a &amp;#163;5 pot of generic moisturiser. Anyway, when I went to pay,&lt;br&gt;instead of the self-service checkout asking whether I wanted to buy a bag,&lt;br&gt;there simply were no bags. There was only a little Boots man wandering&lt;br&gt;around with a handful of bags. I told him I wanted to buy one, but I had no&lt;br&gt;change. He shoved a little paper bag into my hand and whispered, &amp;#8220;Go, go,&lt;br&gt;run away!&amp;#8221; which I promptly did. Hilarious.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title type="text">Shopping on a real tight budget (again).</title>
    <content type="html">Went for a walk earlier because like Old Mother Hubbard my cupboard was bare .Didnt have a lot of cash so first stop was the fruit/veg market as they were packing up looked through a few boxes and ended up with about 40 apples.a pineapple,6 nice carrots,garlic and all for the bargain price of £0.00.Next stop a Health food place that every night puts out a few bags of goodies just reaching the sell by date ,its all perfectly good food.the haul was 200g of Cornish Camembert,125g of goats cheese,18 Glenilen Farm probiotic yoghurts 160g jars I kept 6 and redistributed the others to homeless people on my journey home.I called at Sainsburys and was able to splash out on Normandy butter ,a sunflower+honey bloomer loaf,Youngs fish ,a £4 ham and pineapple pizza so its good eating today.After washing/scrubbing the free fruit/veg it was juiced and produced 4 pints of juice better and fresher than the stuff bought in the shops.It still amazes and pisses me off the amount of good food throw away and destined for landfills while so many people are havuing a hard time and starving.Just grateful Im not one of them.</content>

    <title type="text">SELLING BIG ISSUES ,a honest profession.</title>
    <content type="html">&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Its my opinion that selling Big Issues is a honest honarable way to make a living.Ive been doing it on and off from the very begining, sure Im critical of the way its run but the benefits far outweigh the negative aspects.So the wages are not the best in the world but your rewards come in the form of the great orduinary people that you meet.Im not the sort that pushes it in peoples faces,I like to think that people who buy from me do so because they want to not because Ive put pressure on them or made them feel guilty in any way.In the past year Ive had a professional fundraising org headhunting me,telling me I could make 4 times as much for less effort.Truth is if I was to shake a bucket claiming the money was for starving third world children well thats where it would have to go,not in my pocket.Im no angel and while selling Big Issues if anyone asks I tell them the money is for me and if asked I tell them my housing status.Like I say Im honest like all the other venders, we dont make a living from other peoples misery - only our own.My advice before parting with money to a charity think about how much reaches those that need it.</content>

    <title type="text">If hostel systems work,why do so many end up back on the streets.</title>
    <content type="html">My apologies for ranting about time spent in the&amp;nbsp; hostel system but in my opinion it was 6yrs of my life wasted.6 years where I had to have a keywork session with a moron every week and awnser the same questions over and over again.FFS how long does it take to asses someone and see if they are suitable for housing.Im of the opinion its a deliberate conspiracy to prove to society how essential they are in the rehabilitation of poor unfortunates like myself.Only thing is Ive never thought of&amp;nbsp; myself as unfortunate no matter what apart from the times I had to sit and listen to all their fucking crap.I put up with it because I wanted a permanent place of my own without them having acsess to my room or supported housing unit so the nosey fuckers could snoop while I was out.I often used toleave little notes for them to find but only offensive ones.They couldnt say anything about this as they shouldn have been snooping .Its a fact if I had a key to their houses and did to them what they do to their residents I would probably be branded a pervert and locked up for a long time.In a nutshell hostels dont work as most residents end up back on the streets or are kicked out for raising hell about their draconian rules.</content>

    <title type="text">The Drugworker</title>
    <content type="html">Not all of the people working for homeless orgs are money grabbing careerists,or worse stupid.sOME ARE ANGELS i DONT HAVE TO NAME THEM THEY KNOW WHO THEY ARE its a tradgedy that they are more often than not in a surbordinate position and stick with their job to genuinly help.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;I know a girl ,I say girl even though shes in her mid 40s now,she was a teenager when I met her begging on the Hungerford Bridge in the 80s.For over 20yrs she was a hard core heroin user,she knows everey trick in the book that drug users follow,maybe she even wrote it.She got of the drugs sorted her life out got a job with an org that deals with rough sleeping drug users,shes very familiar with the problems and bigotry and difficulty these people face when sorting their lives out or trying.Happy ending - no way,all she gets todo is the donkey work she feels and justibly that she is more qualified than her co-workers,she thinks she has been hired as the token ex-junkie.What a criminal waste of what could be that orgs most valuable asset.Is this her 2nd chance at life,and who could blame her if she went home everynight and stuck a needle in her arm.</content>

    <content type="html">&amp;nbsp; So it been established that rough sleepers have a pretty rough time,one night a outreach worker eventually finds them hidden in some out of the way place,they say I can get you a hostel place,meet me tomorrow.Let me tell you it feels like finding the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.So you meet you go through all the procedures you think peace,safety ,escape from alcholuism ,petty crime,drug addiction&amp;nbsp; and all its related baggage,you feel exstatic but that soon wears off when you are in your cell like room ,it begins to dawn on you that what you are holding in your arms like a new born baby is not as you envisaged a pot of gold but in reality its a bucket of shit.You are so run down tired you dont care anymore so you sleep.You awake to the sound of footsteps in the coridor,keys getting pushed intolocks door slamming obcenities being shouted,youre half asleep thinking shit slop out already,you rush to get dressed looking for the bucket there is none.The door opens you have one leg in your trousers a voice booms room check ,it then dawns on you again you are not in the Holiday Inn ,but a hostel ,you dont yet know youve been sentenced to 6yrs.</content>

    <title type="text">Winky Face!</title>
    <content type="html">I'm just going to come right out and say it. &amp;nbsp;I am not a huge fan of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoticon"&gt;emoticons&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;I do not use a happy face to indicate happiness, or a sad face to indicate sadness. &amp;nbsp;I don't even use LOL when texting or IMing, as I prefer a simple "ha!" to get the idea of laughter accross.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I will acknowledge that I am in the minority. &amp;nbsp;If there was a battle, I lost. &amp;nbsp;Emoticons have won, and I accept their place in the world. &amp;nbsp;I will even admit that they can make the tone of an email or text or whatever clear if the words themselves don't convey the proper meaning. &amp;nbsp;I don't use them myself, but if someone sends me a frowny face or a confused face, I understand their meaning and move on with my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Except!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The winky face. &amp;nbsp;If there is one emoticon I cannot stand, it is the winky face. &amp;nbsp;You know the one I mean:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The intended meaning, as far as I'm aware, is to convey cheekiness or sassiness. &amp;nbsp;And it drives me up the freaking wall. &amp;nbsp;Because here is the thing. &amp;nbsp;In real life, people smile at each other, or frown, or have big smiles, or stick out their tongues (which, ugh), or look surprised. &amp;nbsp;All of which have a corresponding emoticon to convey these expressions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do you know what people don't do? &amp;nbsp;Wink at each other. &amp;nbsp;Constantly wink at each other. &amp;nbsp;And if they do, they should stop, because I'm sure they'll just develop a twitch of some kind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There only two contexts I can think of where winking is appropriate in real life. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One: &amp;nbsp;If you are playing a joke on someone and want to let someone they are with in on the joke subtly. &amp;nbsp;A wink at that person while continuing the joking will get that message across, and then hopefully they'll get in on the joke and you'll all have some fun times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two: &amp;nbsp;A pickup wink, done in jest. &amp;nbsp;Possibly accompanied by finger guns. &amp;nbsp;This works in almost any circumstance in life, and is generally delightful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's it! &amp;nbsp;Those are the only two situations in which you should be winking! &amp;nbsp;Or maybe if you're trying to get a contact back in place. &amp;nbsp;But blinking would also accomplish this, so let's forget that one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, when I see people (and god help me, so many people do this) use the winky face after a comment they mean to be funny, all I can think is STOP STOP STOP! &amp;nbsp;If you need to use an emoticon (and I really must stress that no one &lt;i&gt;needs &lt;/i&gt;to use an emoticon) in that case, will the smiley face not do? &amp;nbsp;What is wrong with the good old smiley face? &amp;nbsp;Are you too good for the smiley face??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your cheekiness comes across as far less cheeky if you have to tell me you're being cheeky! &amp;nbsp;(Also, the work cheeky looks funny when you write it too many times. Cheeky.)&amp;nbsp;Would you really wink in real life after you said whatever you just said? &amp;nbsp;I thought not.&amp;nbsp;It's just dumb. &amp;nbsp;Stop it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, if someone develops an emoticon for the double finger guns, I will have to bow to their genius and gladly allow all winky face/double finger gun emoticon combos, as they will be hilarious.</content>
