			<h2><a href="https://blog.dave.org.uk/2023/02/2022-in-gigs.html">2022 in Gigs</a></h2>
			<p class="post-info">From: davblog</p>

<p>Rather later than usual (again!) here is my review of the best ten gigs I saw in 2022. For the first time since 2019, I did actually see more than ten gigs in 2022 although my total of sixteen falls well short of my pre-pandemic years.</p>



<p>Here are my ten favourite gigs of the year. As always, they&#8217;re in chronological order.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.songkick.com/concerts/39759069-pale-waves-at-roundhouse">Pale Waves at the Roundhouse</a></strong><br>I&#8217;ve seen Pale Waves a few times now and I think they&#8217;ve firmly established their place on my &#8220;see them whenever they tour near me&#8221; list. This show was every bit as good as I&#8217;ve ever seen them.</li>



<li><strong><a href="https://www.songkick.com/concerts/39529194-orchestral-manoeuvres-in-the-dark-at-royal-albert-hall">Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark at the Royal Albert Hall</a></strong><br>Another band I see whenever I can. This was a slightly different set where the first half was called &#8220;Atmospheric&#8221; and concentrated on some deeper cuts from their back catalogue and the second half included all the hits.</li>



<li><strong><a href="https://www.songkick.com/concerts/39529194-orchestral-manoeuvres-in-the-dark-at-royal-albert-hall">Chvrches at Brixton Academy</a></strong><br>In 2020, I moved to a flat that&#8217;s about fifteen minutes&#8217; walk from Brixton Academy. But I had to wait about eighteen months in order to take advantage of that fact. The last couple of times I&#8217;ve seen Chvrches were at Alexandra Palace, so it was nice to see them at a smaller venue again. This show featured a not-entirely unexpected guest appearance from Robert Smith.</li>



<li><strong><a href="https://www.songkick.com/concerts/40060742-sunflower-bean-at-electric-ballroom">Sunflower Bean at Electric Ballroom</a></strong><br>Another act who I see live as often as I can. And this was a great venue to see them in.</li>



<li><strong><a href="https://www.songkick.com/concerts/39584368-pet-shop-boys-at-o2">Pet Shop Boys at the O2 Arena</a></strong><br>There&#8217;s always one show a year that draws me to the soulless barn that is the O2 Arena. Every time I go there, I vow it&#8217;ll be the last time &#8211; but something always pulls me back. This year it was the chance to see a band I loved in the 80s and have never seen live. This was a fabulous greatest hits show that had been postponed from 2020.</li>



<li><strong><a href="https://www.songkick.com/concerts/39894954-lorde-at-roundhouse">Lorde at the Roundhouse</a></strong><br>A new Lorde album means another Lorde tour. And, like Chvrches, she swapped the huge expanse of Alexandra Palace for multiple nights at a smaller venue. This was a very theatrical show that matched the vibe of the <em>Solar Power</em> album really well.</li>



<li><strong><a href="https://www.songkick.com/concerts/40274226-lcd-soundsystem-at-o2-academy-brixton">LCD Soundsystem at Brixton Academy</a></strong><br>Another show at Brixton Academy. For some reason, I didn&#8217;t know about this show until I walked past the venue a few days before and saw the &#8220;sold out&#8221; signs. But a day or so later, I got an email from the venue offering tickets. So I snapped one up and had an amazing evening. It was the first time I&#8217;d seen them, but I strongly suspect it won&#8217;t be the last. That&#8217;s them in the photo at the top of this post.</li>



<li><strong><a href="https://www.songkick.com/concerts/40320756-roxy-music-at-o2">Roxy Music at the O2 Arena</a></strong><br>Some years there are two shows that force me to the O2 Arena. And this was one of those years. I&#8217;ve been a fan of Roxy Music since the 70s but I&#8217;ve never seen them live. Honestly, it would have been better to have seen them in the 70s or 80s, but it was still a great show.</li>



<li><strong><a href="https://www.songkick.com/concerts/40313030-beabadoobee-at-o2-academy-brixton">Beabadoobee at Brixton Academy</a></strong><br>Sometimes you go to see an artist because of one song and it just works out. This was one of those nights. In fact, it turns out I didn&#8217;t actually know &#8220;Coffee For Your Head&#8221; very well &#8211; I just knew the sample that was used in another artist&#8217;s record. But this was a great night and I hope to see her again very soon.</li>



<li><strong><a href="https://www.songkick.com/concerts/40493394-sugababes-at-eventim-apollo">Sugababes at Eventim Apollo</a></strong><br>Another night of fabulous nostalgia. The Eventim Apollo seems to have become my venue of choice to see re-formed girl groups from the 80s and 90s &#8211; having seen Bananarama, All Saints and now The Sugababes there in recent years. They have a surprising number of hits (far more than I remembered before the show) and they put on a great show.</li>
</ul>



<p>Not everything could make the top ten though. I think was the first year that I saw Stealing Sheep and they didn&#8217;t make the list (their stage shows just get weirder and weirder and the Moth Club wasn&#8217;t a great venue for it) and I was astonished to find myself slightly bored at the Nine Inch Nails show at Brixton Academy.</p>



<p>A few shows sit just outside of the top ten &#8211; St. Vincent at the Eventim Apollo, John Grant at the Shepherd&#8217;s Bush Empire and Damon Albarn at the Barbican spring to mind.</p>



<p>But, all in all, it was a good year for live music and I&#8217;m looking forward to seeing more than sixteen shows this year.</p>



<p>Did you see any great shows this year? Tell us about them in the comments.</p>

			<h2><a href="https://blog.dave.org.uk/2022/12/5-reasons-why-using-ai-to-generate-blog-posts-can-destroy-your-seo.html">5 Reasons Why Using AI to Generate Blog Posts Can Destroy Your SEO</a></h2>
			<p class="post-info">From: davblog</p>

<p>Using artificial intelligence (AI) to generate blog posts can be bad for search engine optimization (SEO) for several reasons.</p>



<p>First and foremost, AI-generated content is often low quality and lacks the depth and substance that search engines look for when ranking content. Because AI algorithms are not capable of understanding the nuances and complexities of human language, the content they produce is often generic, repetitive, and lacks originality. This can make it difficult for search engines to understand the context and relevance of the content, which can negatively impact its ranking.</p>



<p>Additionally, AI-generated content is often not well-written or structured, which can make it difficult for readers to understand and engage with. This can lead to a high bounce rate (the percentage of visitors who leave a website after only viewing one page), which can also hurt the website&#8217;s ranking.</p>



<p>Furthermore, AI-generated content is often not aligned with the website&#8217;s overall content strategy and goals. Because AI algorithms are not capable of understanding the website&#8217;s target audience, brand voice, and core messaging, the content they produce may not be relevant or useful to the website&#8217;s visitors. This can lead to a poor user experience, which can also hurt the website&#8217;s ranking.</p>



<p>Another issue with AI-generated content is that it can be seen as spammy or low quality by both search engines and readers. Because AI-generated content is often produced in large quantities and lacks originality, it can be seen as an attempt to manipulate search engine rankings or trick readers into engaging with the website. This can lead to the website being penalized by search engines or losing the trust and loyalty of its visitors.</p>



<p>In conclusion, using AI to generate blog posts can be bad for SEO for several reasons. AI-generated content is often low quality, poorly written, and not aligned with the website&#8217;s content strategy. It can also be seen as spammy or low quality by both search engines and readers, which can hurt the website&#8217;s ranking and reputation. It is important for websites to prioritize creating high-quality, original, and relevant content to improve their SEO and provide a positive user experience.</p>

			<h2><a href="https://blog.dave.org.uk/2022/05/should-children-be-polite-while-using-smart-speakers.html">Should Children be Polite While Using Smart Speakers?</a></h2>
			<p class="post-info">From: davblog</p>
<p>‘Okay Google. Where is Antarctica?”</p>
<p>Children can now get answers to all their questions using smart speakers and digital voice assistants.</p>
<p>A few years ago, children would run to their parents or grandparents to answer their questions. But with the ascendence of voice assistants to the mainstream in recent years, many children rely more on technology than humans.</p>
<p>Is this a good idea?</p>
<p>How does it impact the children?</p>
<p>When children interact with people, it helps them be more thoughtful, creative, and imaginative.</p>
<p>When they use artificial intelligence instead, several issues come into the foreground. These include access to age-inappropriate content and increasing the possibility of being rude or unpleasant, affecting how they treat others.</p>
<p>As mentioned, technology has both pros and cons. There are benefits to children using these devices, including improving diction, communication, social skills, and gaining information without bothering their parents.</p>
<p>Many families find that smart speakers like Amazon Echo and Google Home are useful. They use them for several functions, ranging from answering questions to setting the thermostat. Research shows that up to nine out of ten children between the ages of four and eleven in the US are regularly using smart speakers — often without parental guidance and control. So, what is the best approach for a parent to take?</p>
<p>Children up to seven years old can find it challenging to differentiate between humans and devices, and this can lead to one of the biggest dangers. If the device fulfils their requests through rude behaviour, children may behave similarly to other humans.</p>
<h2>Do Parents Think Smart Devices Should Encourage Polite Conversations?</h2>
<p>Most parents consider it essential that smart devices should encourage polite conversations as a part of nurturing good habits in children. The Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood or CCFA is a US coalition of concerned parents, healthcare professionals, and educators. Recently, CCFA protested against Amazon Echo Dot Kids Edition, stating that it may affect children’s wellbeing. Because of this, they requested parents avoid buying Amazon Echo.</p>
<p>However, in reality, these smart devices have improved a lot and focus on encouraging polite conversations with children. It is all about how parents use and present these devices to their children, as these factors can influence them a lot.</p>
<p>But in simple terms, parents wish these devices to encourage politeness in their children. At the same time, they want their kids to understand the difference between artificial intelligence and humans while using these technological innovations.</p>
<h2>Do Parents Think Their Children are Less Polite While Using Smart Speakers?</h2>
<p>Many parents have seen their children behave rudely to smart speakers. Several parents have expressed their concerns through social media, blog posts and forums like Mumsnet. They fear these behaviours can impact their kids when they grow up.</p>
<p>A report published in Child Wise reached the conclusion that children who behave rudely to smart devices might be aggressive while they grow up, especially while dealing with other humans. It is, therefore, preferable if children use polite words while interacting with both humans and smart devices.</p>
<h2>What Approaches Have Been Taken By Tech Companies to Address the Problem?</h2>
<p>With interventions and rising concerns addressed by parents and health professionals, some tech companies have brought changes to virtual assistants and smart speakers.</p>
<p>The parental control features available in Alexa focus on training kids to be more polite. Amazon brands it as Magic Word, where the focus is on bringing positive enforcement. However, there is no penalty if children don’t speak politely. Available on Amazon Echo, this tool has added features like setting bedtimes, switching off devices, and blocking songs with explicit lyrics.</p>
<p>When it comes to Google Home, it has brought in a new feature called Pretty Please. Here, Google will perform an action only when children use, please. For instance, “Okay, Google. Please set the timer for 15 minutes.”</p>
<p>You can enable this feature through the Google Family Link, where you can find the settings for Home and Assistant. You can set these new standards for devices of your preference. Also, once you use it and figure things out, there will be no more issues in setting it up again.</p>
<p>These tools and their approaches are highly beneficial for kids and parents. As of now, these devices only offer basic features and limited replies. But with time, there could be technological changes that encourage children to have much more efficient and polite interactions.</p>
<h2>George and the Smart Home</h2>
<p>It was thinking about issues like this which led me to write my first children’s book — George and the Smart Home. In the book, George is a young boy who has problems getting the smart speakers in his house to do what he wants until he learns to be polite to them.</p>
<p>It is available now, as a paperback and a Kindle book, from Amazon.</p>
<p>Buy it from: <a href="https://amazon.com.au/dp/B09VPLGMBN">AU</a> / <a href="https://amazon.com.br/dp/B09VPLGMBN">BR</a> / <a href="https://amazon.ca/dp/B09VPLGMBN">CA</a> / <a href="https://amazon.de/dp/B09VPLGMBN">DE</a> / <a href="https://amazon.es/dp/B09VPLGMBN">ES</a> / <a href="https://amazon.fr/dp/B09VPLGMBN">FR</a> / <a href="https://amazon.in/dp/B09VPLGMBN">IN</a> / <a href="https://amazon.it/dp/B09VPLGMBN">IT</a> / <a href="https://amazon.co.jp/dp/B09VPLGMBN">JP</a> / <a href="https://amazon.com.mx/dp/B09VPLGMBN">MX</a> / <a href="https://amazon.nl/dp/B09VPLGMBN">NL</a> / <a href="https://amazon.co.uk/dp/B09VPLGMBN">UK</a> / <a href="https://amazon.com/dp/B09VPLGMBN">US</a></p>

			<h2><a href="https://blog.dave.org.uk/2022/01/2021-in-gigs.html">2021 in Gigs</a></h2>
			<p class="post-info">From: davblog</p>
<p>A little later than usual, here&#8217;s my review of the gigs I saw last year.</p>
<p>In 2020, I saw four gigs. In 2021, I almost doubled that to seven. Obviously, we spent a lot of the year with most music venues closed, so those few gigs I saw were all in the second half of the year. Usually, I&#8217;d list my top ten gigs. This year (as last year) I&#8217;ll be listing them all. So here they are in chronological order.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.songkick.com/concerts/39755096-mike-oldfield-at-royal-festival-hall-southbank-centre">Tubular Bells at the Royal Festival Hall</a></strong><br />
This was a strange show for several reasons. Firstly, it was advertised as commemorating the fiftieth anniversary of <em>Tubular Bells</em>. But the album was released in 1973, so it was two years early (apparently it was the fiftieth anniversary of when Mike Oldfield started writing the piece). Secondly, Mike Oldfield wasn&#8217;t performing &#8211; but you needed to examine the publicity very carefully to work that out. And thirdly, there was a troupe of acrobats that were pointlessly leaping around the stage while the musicians played. All in all, I thought this was slightly disappointing.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.songkick.com/concerts/38968289-heaven-17-at-roundhouse">Heaven 17 at the Roundhouse</a></strong><br />
Many of these shows were postponed from 2020. This was originally intended to celebrate the fortieth anniversary of the Human League album, <em>Travelogue</em>, but it ended but being the forty-first anniversary. But none of that mattered. This was Heaven 17 playing all of the first two Human League albums and it was absolutely wonderful. Apparently, they had invited Phil Oakey to take part, but he wasn&#8217;t interested. That&#8217;s Heaven 17 in the photo above.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.songkick.com/concerts/39828850-lump-at-scala">LUMP at the Scala</a></strong><br />
LUMP is Laura Marling playing with Tunng&#8217;s Mike Lindsay. I kinda assumed that their first album was going to be a one-off, but they produced a second album in 2020. This was the first gig I&#8217;d been to in a cramped venue like the Scala for a couple of years and it all got a bit too much for me. I really didn&#8217;t enjoy the atmosphere and left during the third or fourth song. I still love the album though and I hope to build up my tolerance for gig crowds over the coming months.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.songkick.com/concerts/39773071-staves-at-o2-shepherds-bush-empire">The Staves at Shepherd&#8217;s Bush Empire</a></strong><br />
Actually, this was only two-thirds of the Staves. One of the sisters has has a baby recently and has decided to sit out tours for a couple of years. But the two remaining sisters still put on a great show.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.songkick.com/concerts/39786793-laura-marling-at-roundhouse">Laura Marling at the Roundhouse</a></strong><br />
Given how few gigs I saw last year, it&#8217;s surprising how repetitive they were. Here&#8217;s Laura Marling again (and the Roundhouse again!) Although she has yet to match the heights of the <em>Short Movie</em> tour, Laura Marling is always worth seeing and this show was no exception.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.songkick.com/concerts/39662320-heaven-17-at-o2-shepherds-bush-empire">Heaven 17 at the Shepherd&#8217;s Bush</a></strong><strong><a href="https://www.songkick.com/concerts/39662320-heaven-17-at-o2-shepherds-bush-empire"> Empire</a></strong><br />
More repetition. I think the two Heaven 17 gigs were originally supposed to be several months apart, but the vagaries of the Covid scheduling changes led to them being just two months apart. This one celebrated the fortieth (actually forty-first) anniversary of Heaven 17 starting and was a glorious journey through their back catalogue. Oh, and the support was Pete Wylie, so I can finally say I&#8217;ve seen all three members of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crucial_Three">Crucial Three</a> live.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.songkick.com/concerts/39709208-orchestral-manoeuvres-in-the-dark-at-eventim-apollo">Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark at Hammersmith Apollo</a></strong><br />
OMD are just one of those bands that I see live whenever I can. I&#8217;ve now been seeing them for over forty years (since they supported Gary Numan in 1980). They have such a massive back catalogue that they can just play hit after hit for two hours. But this show was a bit different as they started by playing all of their 1981 album, <em>Architecture and Morality</em>. They were as good as I&#8217;ve ever seen them.</li>
</ul>
<p>And that was 2021. What will happen in 2022? Well, I have tickets for a dozen or shows but who knows how many of them I&#8217;ll actually see? I&#8217;ve already had emails postponing the Wolf Alice and Peter Hook shows I was going to see this month. I guess I&#8217;ll just have to wait and see how the rest of the year pans out.</p>

			<h2><a href="https://blog.dave.org.uk/2021/09/the-return-of-rtd.html">The Return of RTD</a></h2>
			<p class="post-info">From: davblog</p>
<p><em>Doctor Who</em> has a new showrunner. But he’s actually an old showrunner. Is that a good idea?</p>
<p>Since <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-58682472">the news broke</a> yesterday, <em>Doctor Who</em> fan forums have been discussing nothing but the fact that Russell T Davies is returning as showrunner after Chris Chibnall’s regeneration special is broadcast next year. Most fans seem to be very excited by this prospect; I’m not so sure.</p>
<p>Before I start, I should point out that I’ve been a big fan of Russell T Davies since long before he brought <em>Doctor Who</em> back to our screens in 2005. I’ll always be grateful for the work he did to bring the show back and I believe that he’s responsible for some great moments in <em>Doctor Who</em> history.</p>
<p>But I’m not sure I want to see him back as the showrunner. Let me explain why I’m so out of step with most of the show’s fans.</p>
<p>Firstly, although I’m grateful to him for bringing the show back, he’s not my favourite showrunner. Obviously, any <em>Doctor Who</em> is better than no <em>Doctor Who</em> but there was a lot of stuff in Davies’ first run that I didn’t like. For example, He was the person who first introduced us to companions’ families, which brought a slight soap opera feel to some of the episodes. Also, I thought that he often wrote himself into a bit of a corner. This was most apparent in the end of season two-parters. There were many occasions when the first part set up a fantastic premise only to be let down by a finale that just couldn’t live up to the promise. <em>The Stolen Earth</em> was great; <em>Journey’s End</em> was terrible. Then there’s <em>The End of Time</em>. Again, it started off well but had verged well into the ridiculous by the end of the first part. And don’t get me started on the self-indulgent, mawkish nonsense that made up the last twenty minutes of that story — leading to the Tenth Doctor’s regeneration.</p>
<p>I admit, however, that my opinions on Davies’ writing are purely personal. And, because of the massive rise in popularity of the show during his tenure, many viewers see his approach as the gold standard for how the show should work. My other points are, I hope, less opinion-based.</p>
<p>Secondly, <em>Doctor Who</em> is a show that should always be moving forward. In the classic era of the show, previous Doctors and companions would reappear very rarely. When someone left the show, you knew the chances of seeing them again were very slim. When an executive producer left (we didn’t call them showrunners back then) you knew that the show would change in new and experimental ways. Sometimes the changes didn’t work; most of the time they did. Change is fundamental to the show. It’s how the show has kept going for (most of) sixty years.</p>
<p>The newer sections of the audience don’t seem to realise that. I constantly hear fans wanting things to go back to how things were. As soon as Rose was written out at the end of series two, there were calls for her to come back. And while series four has some pretty good stuff in it, I think that bringing Rose back was pandering to the fanbase in an unhealthy way. We now have a situation where fans expect every character who has been written out of the show to be brought back at their whim. There aren’t very many weeks that pass without me seeing someone in a Facebook group suggesting some convoluted way that David Tennant could be brought back to be the Doctor again.</p>
<p>The show must always move forward. It must always change. I believe that RTD knows that, so I hope that his second era in charge will be sufficiently different to his first. But I worry that fans will start asking for Tennant back as the Doctor with Billie Piper by his side. For some fans, that seems to be the only version of the show they will be happy with.</p>
<p>Finally, I worry about what RTD’s reappointment means for the future of the show. When Chibnall’s departure was announced, all of the news stories claimed that he and Whittaker had a “three and out agreement” between themselves and that he only ever planned to do three years running the show. That’s rather at odds with the talk of him having a five-year plan for the show when he was appointed to the role. I realise that he will have done five years in the post by the time he goes, but he will have made three seasons and a handful of specials — so I’m not sure that counts.</p>
<p>No, I think it’s clear that Chibnall has been hounded out of the role by that toxic sector of the fanbase that refuses to give his work on the show a decent chance. And, given that Moffat also put up with a lot of abuse from certain fans, I begin to wonder how easy it is to find someone to take over the job. Chibnall’s departure was announced at the end of July and the BBC would certainly have known about it for some time before that. But they have failed to find someone new and exciting to take over the job and I wonder if it has become a bit of a poison chalice. People want to do the job because, hey, it’s running Doctor Who! But, on the other hand, if you don’t please the fanbase (and no-one can please all of the fanbase) then you’ll be vilified online and hounded off social media. Add to that the fact that both Davies and Moffat cited insane working schedules as part of their reason for leaving and, suddenly, the job doesn’t look quite as tempting.</p>
<p>I have no inside information here at all, but I wonder if the reappointment of RTD was an act of desperation on the part of the BBC. We know that Chibnall is steering the show up to and including a BBC centenary special that will be broadcast in 2022. But the show’s 60th anniversary is the year after that and without a showrunner, you can’t cast a new Doctor and without a new Doctor in place pretty soon, the 60th-anniversary celebrations would seem to be in danger.</p>
<p>The news of the reappointment has all been very celebratory, of course, but I wonder if that’s actually the case. I wonder if the BBC’s approach to RTD was more like this:</p>
<p>“So, that show you resurrected back in 2005. Well, we can’t find anyone to take over as showrunner, and unless we get things moving pretty quickly we’re not going to have a 60th anniversary worth speaking off. Seriously, we’re thinking of just cancelling it… unless you can suggest something that we could do…”</p>
<p>This, of course, leaves RTD thinking that the only way to save his baby is to step in himself. Maybe he’s stepped in as a stop-gap until the BBC finds someone else to take over. The announcement says he’s signed on for the 60th special and following series. But that’s a bit vague (because the English language doesn’t have a plural for “series”!) so who knows how long he’ll hang around for. Time will tell, I guess.</p>
<p>But, if you’re one of those fans who think it’s big or clever to be unrelentingly negative about the showrunner on social media, please stop and consider whether you’re part of a problem that could end up with no-one wanting the job and the show being cancelled.</p>
<p>All-in-all, I wish that the BBC hadn’t done this. I would have far preferred to see the show moving forward. But if, as I suspect, the alternative was no new Doctor Who for the foreseeable future, then obviously this is a good plan. I’m keen to see what Davies has in store.</p>
<p>But first I’m really excited to see what Chibnall has in store for his final series and the subsequent specials. If series 13 improves on series 12 to the extent that series 12 improved on series 11, then it’s going to be great.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Driving down to Bristol for sister's wedding. We pass an estate agents window which has little model houses in the window like at Bekenscot.<br>
Me: Laura, look at the cute little houses. Which one would you live in?<br>
Laura: I can't really see them.<br>
Me: I like the white one best, but the green one has bigger windows.<br>
Laura: oh those houses. I thought you meant the houses they were advertising in the window. I was wondering how you could possibly see them.<br>
Chris: I thought you meant the ones in the photos.<br>
Alice: so did I.<br>
Me: how could I possibly have seen the ones in the photographs? What, have I suddenly developed super eyesight?<br>
Chris: that's what I thought. So I thought you must be talking just for the sake of saying something.<br>
Me: when do I ever do that?<br>
Chris: exactly. So I thought you must have gone mad.<br>
Me: so you'd rather ignore everything you know about me and assume that I'd gone mad, rather than entertain the possibility that I might have been talking about the cute little model houses, which only that estate agent has, rather than the photos of houses, which every estate agent has?<br>
Chris: I didn't think they were cute.<br>
Me: surely it's more plausible that I meant the model houses but that what I think is cute is different from what you think is cute, rather than that I'd suddenly developed super eyesight and also lost my mind?<br>
Chris: your position is indefensible<br>
Me: my position is defensible. I am defending it, unfortunately I appear to be dealing with a bunch of dopes<br>

			<h2><a href="http://theoreticalheuristics.blogspot.com/2015/10/fall-out-boy.html">Fall Out Boy</a></h2>
			<p class="post-info">From: wandsworth witterings</p>
<p dir="ltr">I'm in the grip of several slow-burning obsessions at the moment. Fall Out Boy, for one, I'm sort of crushing on them collectively. What a difference a live gig makes! It's hard to say why as most of the time you had to watch them on the big screens (and why is that different from watching them on YouTube?), but that is the mystery of human presence. Being there, in the same air as people, makes a difference. Why? Maybe they seem more real. Maybe you see everything, not just what the cameraman directs you to see, which helps to fill in the reality of someone.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Then I've started my new Elena Ferrante book. I wonder if a Lila really existed, or if the author is simply applying herself into two and writing about both halves. I wish I could get the girls to read it: it's such an eye-opening validating piece of work, especially for women. Some woman in the paper was worrying that it wasn&#8217;t really literature. Why? Why not? What is<br>
unliterary about it? The fact that it&#8217;s enjoyable? The fact that it acts as<br>
though what two young girls in Naples in <u>mid-twentieth</u> century thought or<br>
felt is important? I don&#8217;t see how you could find a book more serious intelligent and authentic than these novels are turning out to be.</p>
<p dir="ltr">On a more trivial note, I've been reading about Kate Moss&#8217; new squeeze in the Telegraph: Nikolai von Bismarck, who from a quick piece of deductive work via Wikipedia, must be the second nephew of Gottfried von Bismarck (the first cousin of Nikolai&#8217;s father Leopold, who was the younger brother of Gottfried&#8217;s father, the<br>
Prince von Bismarck). I knew Gottfried from Oxford when we were both in a<br>
Ionesco play, The Lesson, being directed by an acquaintance from New College. I didn&#8217;t really know Gottfried, what with him being such a posho, but he seemed perfectly nice. He moved with the Olivia Channon set and died himself a few years ago, essentially from his lifestyle (drugs, gay orgies etc). All rather sad: gilded youth! This was all post the ITV Brideshead craze. Little did I think, as I was living through it, that people would be looking back at the eighties in a haze of nostalgia.</p>
<p dir="ltr">At lunch I went out and bought some Vichy Aqualia Thermal Serum because it<br>
was on a Guardian list of best skincare products and I&#8217;m running out of<br>
face cream. I don&#8217;t even know how to use it! It was &#163;5 off. I wonder if it<br>
will have any detectible effect on my skin, that wouldn&#8217;t be just as well<br>
achieved with a &#163;5 pot of generic moisturiser. Anyway, when I went to pay,<br>
instead of the self-service checkout asking whether I wanted to buy a bag,<br>
there simply were no bags. There was only a little Boots man wandering<br>
around with a handful of bags. I told him I wanted to buy one, but I had no<br>
change. He shoved a little paper bag into my hand and whispered, &#8220;Go, go,<br>
run away!&#8221; which I promptly did. Hilarious.</p>

Went for a walk earlier because like Old Mother Hubbard my cupboard was bare .Didnt have a lot of cash so first stop was the fruit/veg market as they were packing up looked through a few boxes and ended up with about 40 apples.a pineapple,6 nice carrots,garlic and all for the bargain price of £0.00.Next stop a Health food place that every night puts out a few bags of goodies just reaching the sell by date ,its all perfectly good food.the haul was 200g of Cornish Camembert,125g of goats cheese,18 Glenilen Farm probiotic yoghurts 160g jars I kept 6 and redistributed the others to homeless people on my journey home.I called at Sainsburys and was able to splash out on Normandy butter ,a sunflower+honey bloomer loaf,Youngs fish ,a £4 ham and pineapple pizza so its good eating today.After washing/scrubbing the free fruit/veg it was juiced and produced 4 pints of juice better and fresher than the stuff bought in the shops.It still amazes and pisses me off the amount of good food throw away and destined for landfills while so many people are havuing a hard time and starving.Just grateful Im not one of them.

&nbsp;&nbsp; Its my opinion that selling Big Issues is a honest honarable way to make a living.Ive been doing it on and off from the very begining, sure Im critical of the way its run but the benefits far outweigh the negative aspects.So the wages are not the best in the world but your rewards come in the form of the great orduinary people that you meet.Im not the sort that pushes it in peoples faces,I like to think that people who buy from me do so because they want to not because Ive put pressure on them or made them feel guilty in any way.In the past year Ive had a professional fundraising org headhunting me,telling me I could make 4 times as much for less effort.Truth is if I was to shake a bucket claiming the money was for starving third world children well thats where it would have to go,not in my pocket.Im no angel and while selling Big Issues if anyone asks I tell them the money is for me and if asked I tell them my housing status.Like I say Im honest like all the other venders, we dont make a living from other peoples misery - only our own.My advice before parting with money to a charity think about how much reaches those that need it.

			<p class="post-info">From: vendazero</p>
My apologies for ranting about time spent in the&nbsp; hostel system but in my opinion it was 6yrs of my life wasted.6 years where I had to have a keywork session with a moron every week and awnser the same questions over and over again.FFS how long does it take to asses someone and see if they are suitable for housing.Im of the opinion its a deliberate conspiracy to prove to society how essential they are in the rehabilitation of poor unfortunates like myself.Only thing is Ive never thought of&nbsp; myself as unfortunate no matter what apart from the times I had to sit and listen to all their fucking crap.I put up with it because I wanted a permanent place of my own without them having acsess to my room or supported housing unit so the nosey fuckers could snoop while I was out.I often used toleave little notes for them to find but only offensive ones.They couldnt say anything about this as they shouldn have been snooping .Its a fact if I had a key to their houses and did to them what they do to their residents I would probably be branded a pervert and locked up for a long time.In a nutshell hostels dont work as most residents end up back on the streets or are kicked out for raising hell about their draconian rules.

Not all of the people working for homeless orgs are money grabbing careerists,or worse stupid.sOME ARE ANGELS i DONT HAVE TO NAME THEM THEY KNOW WHO THEY ARE its a tradgedy that they are more often than not in a surbordinate position and stick with their job to genuinly help.<br />
&nbsp;I know a girl ,I say girl even though shes in her mid 40s now,she was a teenager when I met her begging on the Hungerford Bridge in the 80s.For over 20yrs she was a hard core heroin user,she knows everey trick in the book that drug users follow,maybe she even wrote it.She got of the drugs sorted her life out got a job with an org that deals with rough sleeping drug users,shes very familiar with the problems and bigotry and difficulty these people face when sorting their lives out or trying.Happy ending - no way,all she gets todo is the donkey work she feels and justibly that she is more qualified than her co-workers,she thinks she has been hired as the token ex-junkie.What a criminal waste of what could be that orgs most valuable asset.Is this her 2nd chance at life,and who could blame her if she went home everynight and stuck a needle in her arm.

&nbsp; So it been established that rough sleepers have a pretty rough time,one night a outreach worker eventually finds them hidden in some out of the way place,they say I can get you a hostel place,meet me tomorrow.Let me tell you it feels like finding the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.So you meet you go through all the procedures you think peace,safety ,escape from alcholuism ,petty crime,drug addiction&nbsp; and all its related baggage,you feel exstatic but that soon wears off when you are in your cell like room ,it begins to dawn on you that what you are holding in your arms like a new born baby is not as you envisaged a pot of gold but in reality its a bucket of shit.You are so run down tired you dont care anymore so you sleep.You awake to the sound of footsteps in the coridor,keys getting pushed intolocks door slamming obcenities being shouted,youre half asleep thinking shit slop out already,you rush to get dressed looking for the bucket there is none.The door opens you have one leg in your trousers a voice booms room check ,it then dawns on you again you are not in the Holiday Inn ,but a hostel ,you dont yet know youve been sentenced to 6yrs.

			<h2><a href="http://aliceworld.blogspot.com/2011/08/winky-face.html">Winky Face!</a></h2>
			<p class="post-info">From: alice's dark place</p>
I'm just going to come right out and say it. &nbsp;I am not a huge fan of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoticon">emoticons</a>. &nbsp;I do not use a happy face to indicate happiness, or a sad face to indicate sadness. &nbsp;I don't even use LOL when texting or IMing, as I prefer a simple "ha!" to get the idea of laughter accross.<br />
<br />
However, I will acknowledge that I am in the minority. &nbsp;If there was a battle, I lost. &nbsp;Emoticons have won, and I accept their place in the world. &nbsp;I will even admit that they can make the tone of an email or text or whatever clear if the words themselves don't convey the proper meaning. &nbsp;I don't use them myself, but if someone sends me a frowny face or a confused face, I understand their meaning and move on with my life.<br />
<br />
Except!<br />
<br />
The winky face. &nbsp;If there is one emoticon I cannot stand, it is the winky face. &nbsp;You know the one I mean:<br />
<br />
;)<br />
<br />
The intended meaning, as far as I'm aware, is to convey cheekiness or sassiness. &nbsp;And it drives me up the freaking wall. &nbsp;Because here is the thing. &nbsp;In real life, people smile at each other, or frown, or have big smiles, or stick out their tongues (which, ugh), or look surprised. &nbsp;All of which have a corresponding emoticon to convey these expressions.<br />
<br />
Do you know what people don't do? &nbsp;Wink at each other. &nbsp;Constantly wink at each other. &nbsp;And if they do, they should stop, because I'm sure they'll just develop a twitch of some kind.<br />
<br />
There only two contexts I can think of where winking is appropriate in real life. <br />
<br />
One: &nbsp;If you are playing a joke on someone and want to let someone they are with in on the joke subtly. &nbsp;A wink at that person while continuing the joking will get that message across, and then hopefully they'll get in on the joke and you'll all have some fun times.<br />
<br />
Two: &nbsp;A pickup wink, done in jest. &nbsp;Possibly accompanied by finger guns. &nbsp;This works in almost any circumstance in life, and is generally delightful.<br />
<br />
That's it! &nbsp;Those are the only two situations in which you should be winking! &nbsp;Or maybe if you're trying to get a contact back in place. &nbsp;But blinking would also accomplish this, so let's forget that one.<br />
<br />
Two!<br />
<br />
So, when I see people (and god help me, so many people do this) use the winky face after a comment they mean to be funny, all I can think is STOP STOP STOP! &nbsp;If you need to use an emoticon (and I really must stress that no one <i>needs </i>to use an emoticon) in that case, will the smiley face not do? &nbsp;What is wrong with the good old smiley face? &nbsp;Are you too good for the smiley face??<br />
<br />
Your cheekiness comes across as far less cheeky if you have to tell me you're being cheeky! &nbsp;(Also, the work cheeky looks funny when you write it too many times. Cheeky.)&nbsp;Would you really wink in real life after you said whatever you just said? &nbsp;I thought not.&nbsp;It's just dumb. &nbsp;Stop it. <br />
<br />
However, if someone develops an emoticon for the double finger guns, I will have to bow to their genius and gladly allow all winky face/double finger gun emoticon combos, as they will be hilarious.

<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>A person with a little bit of information is usually a danger to themselves and possibly society.  This is particularly the case at a time when <b>something must be done</b>.<br/><br/>A good example of this is the present scandal on MPs' expenses (does it have an official name yet - "Duck-gate").  A number of people have jumped on some analysis by <a href='http://markreckons.blogspot.com/'>Mark Reckons</a>, a LibDem blogger, that seems to indicate there is a <a href='http://markreckons.blogspot.com/2009/05/mps-expenses-and-safe-seats-correlation.html'>positive correlation between the size of an MP's electoral majority and the chances that they will abuse the expenses system</a>.  In essence, the more safe an MP feels, the more likely they are to be a crook.<br/><br/>This apparent correlation has led Mark and a number of other people (such as <a href='http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2009/may/18/mps-expenses-constitution-electoral-reform'>Polly Toynbee </a>and <a href='http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2009/may/18/mps-expenses-constitution-electoral-reform'>Ben Bradshaw</a>) to suggest that we move away from the <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_pass_the_post'>First-Pass-The-Post </a>election system.  Their reasoning is that a <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional_representation'>PR</a> election system would lead to lower majorities for MPs', and according to this correlation, more honest MPs.<br/><br/>Now, the first problem with this is that (I think) the analysis doesn't stand up to scrunity (details of my concerns are <a href='http://markreckons.blogspot.com/2009/05/mps-expenses-and-safe-seats-correlation.html?showComment=1242939618750#c485085803594386952'>here</a>).  Mark has been careful to caveat his statistical conclusions, though I don't think his caveats go far enough.  The caveats, of course, have been ignored by everyone else.<br/><br/>Secondly, even if there is a correlation, it does not mean there is any real or useful link between majorities and honest MPs.  A classic example is the correlation that areas with high level of policing having a high level of crime, leading to the policy conclusion that policing should be reduced as it causes crime.<br/><br/>And finally, what no-one seems to have tried to show is how PR will help, even if the correlation holds.  Though there may be many reasons for PR, tackling MPs expense dodgies seems the flimsest.  Consider:<br/><ul><li>While PR will change the majorities of some MPs, it needn't necessarily lead to the fall in the majorities overall.  You could have some MPs, which after first and second votes, have a larger majority.</li></ul><ul><li>Some forms of PR can lead to more corruption.  For instance, voters have little ability of getting rid of a hated MP in some forms of close list systems, where that MP heads the list.</li></ul><ul><li>It would seem from the evidence of the unseating of <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Hamilton_%28politician%29'>Neil Hamilton</a> in the 1997 election, and the current mass sacking of tarnished MPs, that the current system can act to get rid of sleazy MPs when the voters have the facts.</li></ul>So please, before advocating constitutional reform, can we stop and think for one moment.<br/></div>

			<p class="post-info">From: balham bugle</p>
<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>The third headline on the BBC news website was "<a href='http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/7756241.stm'>Amazon deforestation accelerates</a>".  The article, in doom laden tones, usually consider appropriate by the BBC for environmental stories, states that:<br/><blockquote>The destruction of the Amazon rainforest in Brazil has accelerated for the first time in four years, Brazilian officials say. Satellite images show 11,968 sq km of land was cleared in the year to July, nearly 4% higher than the year before...<br/><br/>In recent years the Brazilian government has been able to celebrate three successive falls in deforestation. But the latest estimate from the National Institute for Space Research, known as INPE, shows that this trend has come to a halt. <br/></blockquote>Now, at a time that the world seems to be falling apart, with the terror attacks in Mumbai, protests in Thailand, the end of Western capitalism, and the assault by the Met police on Parliamentary sovereignty, you would think the ordering of BBC stories is strange. But the biggest sin, is the poverty of the story.<br/><br/>The lesser error is the suggestion that one year data can signal an end of a trend. To be honest, I wouldn't be sure that three years of downward data shows there is a downward trend; but there there is no way to tell whether this year's rise was a new trend or a blip.<br/><br/>But the howler is saying the 12,000 sq km were destroyed (as opposed to trees just being cut down) without any context.  How big is 12,000 sq km?<br/><br/>Using what seems to have been the international benchmark of choice when discussion Amazon destruction, 12,000 sq km is around half of Wales; that seems big.  A more appropriate comparison is that 12,000 sq km is but 0.2 per cent of the total <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_rain_forest'>rainforest</a> area of 5,500,000 sq km.  Or put it another way, this rate of loss would have to continue for 50 years for the present rainforest to fall by 10 per cent; hardly disastrous.<br/><br/><b><em>So the bottom line of the story is there is no evidence that the slowdown of a already very slow fall in the Amazon rainforest has stopped.  A good news story.</em></b> <br/></div>
