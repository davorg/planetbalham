			<h2><a href="https://blog.dave.org.uk/2020/12/2020-in-gigs.html">2020 in Gigs</a></h2>
			<p class="post-info">From: davblog</p>
<p>At about this time of the year, I usually write an overview of the gigs I&#8217;ve seen in the year. The post always starts with me saying how many gigs I&#8217;ve seen during the year. This is the tenth year I&#8217;ve been writing these posts and in that time I&#8217;ve seen between 35 (<a href="https://blog.dave.org.uk/2018/12/2018-in-gigs.html">2018</a>) and 60 (<a href="https://blog.dave.org.uk/2013/12/2013-gigs.html">2013</a>) gigs in a year.</p>
<p>This year, I&#8217;ve seen four gigs.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to add in a strange gig-cum-lecture that I saw a couple of weeks ago in order to list the top five gigs I saw this year. Here they are in chronological order.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.songkick.com/concerts/39231390-john-grant-at-roundhouse">John Grant at the Roundhouse</a></strong><br />
This is the second time I&#8217;ve seen John Grant live. The first time (at the Hammersmith Apollo a few years ago) he had a full band with him, but this time it was just him and a pianist. It was a great start to my gig-going year. I also had a ticket to see him at Alexandra Palace later in the year, but that show has already been postponed twice.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.songkick.com/concerts/39134185-hate-moss-at-old-blue-last">Hate Moss at the Old Blue Last</a></strong><br />
I don&#8217;t go to the Old Blue Last enough. It&#8217;s a tiny room above a pub in Shoreditch and every time I go there I have a really good time. This time I was drawn there because one of the support acts (<a href="https://m-orchestra.com/">M-orchestra</a>) is an old colleague from the BBC who had just started gigging again after a long hiatus. He was great (check out his streams on Facebook) and the fact that the other two acts on the bill were also very good was a bonus.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.songkick.com/concerts/38135579-ladytron-at-heaven">Ladytron at Heaven</a></strong><br />
Another show I went to because of the support act. I try to see <a href="https://stealingsheep.net/">Stealing Sheep</a> whenever I can so I bought a ticket for this just knowing they were on the bill. If you know anything about my musical taste then you&#8217;ll probably be surprised that I had never listened to Ladytron before buying the ticket. I investigated them before the gig and found an amazing band who I&#8217;ve been listening to a lot ever since. That&#8217;s Ladytron in the photo at the top of the page.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.songkick.com/concerts/39140946-tove-lo-at-o2-forum-kentish-town">Tove Lo at the Forum</a></strong><br />
I saw Tove Lo at <a href="https://mightyhoopla.com/">Mighty Hoopla</a> in Brockwell Park in 2019. I&#8217;m not much of a festival fan but I enjoyed her and added her to my list of people to see indoors as soon as possible. This was that show and it was pretty enjoyable stuff, but subsequent events mean it has taken on rather more importance than it might otherwise have enjoyed.</li>
</ul>
<p>I saw Tove Lo on March 12. Eleven days later, Boris Johnson put us in lockdown and my inbox turned into a sea of cancellations and postponements. I had a full schedule of upcoming gigs booked, but they&#8217;ve all been either cancelled or postponed until next year (or, in a couple of cases, 2022). I watched a couple of streamed gigs, but it&#8217;s really not the same at all. I have, however, sneaked in one more kind of gig in between London lockdowns.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.barbican.org.uk/whats-on/2020/event/the-cosmos-with-professor-brian-cox-live-from-the-barbican">Brian Cox and the BBC Symphony Orchestra at the Barbican</a></strong><br />
I don&#8217;t usually include classical shows in these lists. To be honest, I don&#8217;t go to a lot of classical concerts as it&#8217;s mostly not my thing at all. But this was a bit different. Brian Cox gave some brief &#8220;mini-lectures&#8221; between classical pieces that had been chosen to tie in with the questions that he raised. It was a strange show. Probably about a quarter of the seats at the Barbican were used (they sold online tickets too), walking around the venue was very tightly controlled and there was no interval. They even expanded the stage into the stalls in order for the orchestra to be socially distanced. The <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000qkl5">concert is available on the BBC web site</a> for a few weeks if you&#8217;d like to hear it.</li>
</ul>
<p>So what does 2021 hold? Well, it&#8217;s hard to be sure. I&#8217;ve got a fistful of tickets for shows that were postponed from 2020 but, at this point, I wouldn&#8217;t like to guess which ones I&#8217;ll actually get to see.</p>
<p>What about you? What did you get to see before the venues all closed down? What are your predictions for how things will go next year?</p>

			<h2><a href="https://blog.dave.org.uk/2020/02/consuming-culture-16-31-jan-2020.html">Consuming Culture: 16-31 Jan 2020</a></h2>
			<p class="post-info">From: davblog</p>
<p>Here are brief descriptions of the various cultural things I did in the second half of January 2020.</p>
<p><strong>Food: 12:51 (Islington, 2020-01-18)</strong></p>
<p>Our second visit to <a href="https://www.1251.co.uk/">12:51</a>, but the first time we tried the tasting menu. It&#8217;s a bit pricy (£75 a head, I think) but it&#8217;s well worth it. The food was wonderful. And on the night we were there, James Cochran (the chef who owns the restaurant) was there &#8211; although he was serving, rather than being in the kitchen.</p>
<p><strong>Food: Wolkite Kitfo (Holloway, 2020-01-24)</strong></p>
<p>This is an Ethiopian restaurant near Arsenal&#8217;s new stadium. Ethiopian food is really interesting. It&#8217;s usually served piled up on a flatbread called injera. You then tear off bits of the injera and use it to scoop up bits of the food and put it in your mouth. So the injera doubles as both plate and cutlery. If you&#8217;re interested (and I think you should be) then this is a nice local restaurant in which to try it.</p>
<p><strong>Art: 24/7 (Somerset House, 2020-01-29)</strong></p>
<p>The subtitle for <a href="https://www.somersethouse.org.uk/whats-on/247">this exhibition</a> is &#8220;A wake-up call for our non-stop world&#8221;. The pieces here all examine the way that the world has changed over the last twenty years so we are now all more connected much more of the time and how that has affected us. It&#8217;s a very thought-provoking exhibition and I highly recommend you seeing it.</p>
<p><strong>Film: The Personal History of David Copperfield (Screen on the Green, 2020-01-29)</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve never read <em>David Copperfield</em>. I don&#8217;t remember even seeing another film or TV adaptation. So I was probably one of very few people in the cinema who didn&#8217;t know the plot. And, therefore, I have no idea how much this film deviates from the book. It certainly feels like a rather modern take on the book (although it&#8217;s very much set in the nineteenth century). There&#8217;s a great cast and a cracking script. I loved it.</p>
<p><strong>Gig: John Grant (Roundhouse, 2020-01-29)</strong></p>
<p>I love John Grant&#8217;s music and see him live whenever I can (I already have a ticket to see him again at the start of May). This gig was part of the Roundhouse&#8217;s &#8220;In the Round&#8221; where artists play to an all-seated audience. This was a stripped-back set (just John on piano and a keyboard player) which meant that some of his more complex songs were skipped. But he played everything I wanted to hear &#8211; even finishing with a great version of &#8220;Chicken Bones&#8221;.</p>
<p><strong>Gig: Hate Moss (Old Blue Last, 2020-01-30)</strong></p>
<p>It is many years since I was last at the Old Blue Last for a gig. I was drawn back by an old friend who was first on the bill, playing as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCj-S1swulLxU5_pXYR_6pbw">M-Orchestra</a>. I stayed on to see the other two acts. Kill Your Boyfriends were a bit noisy for my tastes, but Hate Moss were well worth staying out for. I&#8217;ll be looking out for them playing London again.</p>
<p><strong>Dance: Sadlers Wells Sampled (Sadlers Wells, 2020-01-31)</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been in London for over 35 years and I&#8217;ve never been to Sadlers Wells. And if you&#8217;re going to fix that, then it makes good sense to go on a night where there&#8217;s a selection of different types of dance on display. There were eight different acts during the night &#8211; from traditional Indian dance and tango to really experimental dance from Company Wayne McGregor and Géométrie Variable. I&#8217;m no expert in dance and this was a great introduction to the breadth of options available.</p>

			<h2><a href="https://blog.dave.org.uk/2020/01/consuming-culture-1-15-jan-2020.html">Consuming Culture: 1-15 Jan 2020</a></h2>
			<p class="post-info">From: davblog</p>
<p>I want to do more blogging this year. So one thing I&#8217;m going to do is to write about the cultural experiences that I have. My plan is to write short reviews of any films, plays, exhibitions and lectures that I go to. To start us off, here&#8217;s what I did in the first half of January.</p>
<p><strong>Film: Last Christmas (Vue Islington, 2020-01-01)</strong></p>
<p>Yes, this got some terrible reviews, but cheesy romcoms are a bit of a guilty pleasure of mine. This isn&#8217;t up to the standards of <em>Four Weddings and a Funeral</em> or <em>Notting Hill</em>, but I really enjoyed it. And I don&#8217;t care how much you judge me for that.</p>
<p><strong>Art: <a href="https://www.thewonderfactory.co.uk/">Wonder Factory</a> (Dalston Works, 2020-01-03)</strong></p>
<p>This was weird. Fifteen rooms have been turned into Instagram-friendly art installations. They are of variable quality, but the best installations (like the marshmallow swimming pool) are very good. It&#8217;s only around until early February (and it seems they&#8217;re now only opening at the weekend) so you should get along to see it soon.</p>
<p><strong>Film: Jojo Rabbit (Screen on the Green, 2020-01-05)</strong></p>
<p>The Hitler Youth isn&#8217;t the most obvious subject for comedy, but this film manages to pull it off brilliantly. It&#8217;s obviously a very delicate balance but director, Taika Waititi, gets it spot on &#8211; while also playing a very funny imaginary Adolf Hitler. I see this has been nominated for the Best Picture Oscar; and that&#8217;s well-deserved.</p>
<p><strong>VR: Doctor Who &#8211; Edge of Time (<a href="https://other.world/">Other World</a>, 2020-01-05)</strong></p>
<p>Other World is a virtual reality arcade in Haggerston and currently, one of the VR experiences they are offering is the Doctor Who game, <em>Edge of Time</em>. Players are put in their individual pods and loaded up with all their VR equipment (headset, headphones and a controller for each hand) by staff before being left alone to help the Thirteenth Doctor save the universe. I confess I got a bit stuck trying to get the Tardis to dematerialise, but I really enjoyed myself and am very tempted to go back for another try.</p>
<p><strong>Play: A Kind of People (<a href="https://royalcourttheatre.com/">Royal Court Theatre</a>, 2020-01-06)</strong></p>
<p>The Royal Court has a brilliant scheme where they make tickets for Monday evening performances available for £12 each. That price makes it very tempting to see plays that you know nothing about. And that&#8217;s what we did for this. We really had no idea what this play was about. It turns out that it&#8217;s an investigation of the various prejudices (racism, sexism, class snobbery, &#8230;) that bubble under the surface of British society. I&#8217;d recommend you go and see it, but it closes in a couple of days.</p>
<p><strong>Meeting: Tech For UK Post-Election Debrief (Onfido Ltd, 2020-01-08)</strong></p>
<p>I want to get along to more tech meet-ups this year and this was my first. Tech For UK is a group of techies who volunteer their time to build tools that increase democratic engagement in the UK. You can see some examples at <a href="https://voter.tools/">voter.tools</a> (this includes my site &#8211; <a href="https://twittelection.co.uk/">TwittElection</a>). This meeting was a discussion about what the group had been doing during the election campaign and where they should focus their efforts in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Art: Bridgit Riley (<a href="https://www.southbankcentre.co.uk/venues/hayward-gallery">Hayward Gallery</a>, 2020-01-15)</strong></p>
<p>I want to make more use of my South Bank membership, and this was a free after-hours, members&#8217; viewing of the exhibition. This is a retrospective of Riley&#8217;s whole career and, therefore, is a great introduction to the breadth of her work. She&#8217;s a fascinating artist (if one who occasionally produces art that can give you a bit of a headache). I recommend seeing the exhibition &#8211; but hurry, it closes on 26 January.</p>

			<p class="post-info">From: davblog</p>
<p>It&#8217;s time that I wrote my now-traditional review of the gigs I saw last year.</p>
<p>It felt like I didn&#8217;t see so many gigs this year, but <a href="https://www.songkick.com/users/davorg/gigography">Songkick tells me</a> I saw 43 which was more than the previous year (but still some considerable way short of the 60 I saw in 2013). I&#8217;ll get to the best ones in a minute, but let&#8217;s talk about a few of the disappointments first.</p>
<p>The first gig I saw in the year was the Residents at the Union Chapel. I wasn&#8217;t really sure what I was expecting, but it was all a bit disjointed and amateur-sounding, so I left before very long. Having really enjoyed the Bananarama reunion tour a couple of years ago, I was looking forward to seeing them (now Siobhan-less) again, particularly at a lovely little venue like Omeara &#8211; but they were a terrible disappointment and wanted to play their new album instead of the hits that I wanted to hear. I really wanted to enjoy the post-Pete Shelley Buzzcocks show at the Albert Hall, but it was a lot like a third-rate Buzzcocks tribute band and I left quite a while before the end.</p>
<p>And here, in chronological order, are my ten favourite gigs of the year.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tears For Fears:</strong> This was postponed from the previous year. It takes a good band to make it worth going to the O2 Arena. And Tears for Fears certainly hit the spot.</li>
<li><strong>Desperate Journalist:</strong> An up and coming band that I really want to hear more from. Oh, and they were supported by She Makes War, who is always worth seeing.</li>
<li><strong>Grant:</strong> This was a slightly strange one. A night of Scandinavian music at the Lexington. We went because we wanted to see the first act, Moses Hightower (who were great). Grant was on next and she totally blew us away. I think we left soon after she finished.</li>
<li><strong>Stealing Sheep:</strong> I don&#8217;t get to see Stealing Sheep as often as I used too, but they were touring this year because of their new album. I saw them twice. I enjoyed the show at Earth in Dalston the most. That&#8217;s them in the photo above.</li>
<li><strong>Sleeper:</strong> I never got to see Sleeper back in the 90s. But I saw them twice this year. I think I just prefered the show at the 100 Club.</li>
<li><strong>Swimming Girls:</strong> I&#8217;ve seen Swimming Girls as a support act and really wanted to see them playing a headline show. I finally got to do that at the Lexington this year. And then they announced they were splitting up.</li>
<li><strong>Cut Copy:</strong> A band that I hadn&#8217;t heard of at the start of this year. But this show at Somerset House was great and I&#8217;d certainly see them again.</li>
<li><strong>Sunflower Bean:</strong> I always love seeing Sunflower Bean and this was at the Borderline (just before it closed down) and I thought the days of seeing them in venues this small were long past.</li>
<li><strong>Midge Ure:</strong> This was pure nostalgia. Midge Ure&#8217;s current band played all Visage&#8217;s first album and Ultravox&#8217;s &#8220;Vienna&#8221; &#8211; two albums that he recorded in 1980.</li>
<li><strong>Amanda Palmer:</strong> This wasn&#8217;t really a gig. It was more of a four-hour-long, intense psychotherapy session with occasional songs. I saw the prototype for this show in Edinburgh last year, but the full version was sensational.</li>
</ul>
<p>Just outside of this list are shows by Pale Waves, Lloyd Cole, Wildwood Kin and OMD.</p>
<p>Oh, and I have a new regular gig-going companion this year. I asked her what her favourite gig of the year was and she voted for the Grant show at the Lexington.</p>
<p>2020 is already shaping up well. I have tickets to see John Grant (twice), Tove Lo and Ladytron. And there&#8217;s some heavyweight nostalgia coming &#8211; with gigs by the Pet Shop Boys and Bauhaus.</p>
<p>What about you? What live music did you really enjoy in 2019?</p>

			<h2><a href="https://blog.dave.org.uk/2019/12/2020-vision.html">2020 Vision</a></h2>
			<p class="post-info">From: davblog</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been working in this industry for a long time &#8211; over thirty years. For most of that time, I&#8217;ve been working as a freelancer, but it&#8217;s always been working for someone else. When I set up <a href="https://mag-sol.com/">Magnum Solutions</a> (my freelancing company) in 1995 I always had a vague desire to grow it into a company that wasn&#8217;t just me selling my time and skills to other companies. But I&#8217;ve never really known how I wanted to do that.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I&#8217;ve spent a lot of those thirty years building web sites in my spare time. Whether it&#8217;s my (now, long defunct) <a href="https://dave.org.uk/streams/">BBC Streams</a> project or current sites like <a href="https://lineofsuccession.co.uk/">Line of Succession</a> or <a href="https://twittelection.co.uk/">TwittElection</a>, there&#8217;s always something that I&#8217;m tinkering with. Some of them get some small level of popularity. None of them has ever made me enough money that I could consider giving up the freelancer life in order to spend more time on one of these projects.</p>
<p>This year has been slightly different. This was the year that the market for Perl freelancers in London finally hit the level at which I decided to take a permanent job. So I&#8217;ve been working for <a href="https://equals.co/">Equals</a> (formerly FairFX) as a senior developer since February. But even that didn&#8217;t feel quite right. It felt a bit like a step backwards to go back to being an employee.</p>
<p>And then, while on holiday a month ago, something crystalised for me during a conversation with a friend. She asked how I&#8217;d really like to spend my time and I replied that I&#8217;d like to take time off from working nine to five and spent it trying to turn one or more of my side-projects into a real business. She asked what was stopping me from doing that and I replied that I didn&#8217;t have enough money. She laughed and asked me what the money in the ISA that I&#8217;ve been paying into on and off for the last decade was for. I&#8217;d always vaguely assumed it was for &#8220;the future&#8221; (whatever that means) but I realised that she was right. There was no reason at all why I shouldn&#8217;t use some of that money to support myself while I took time off work to do what I really wanted.</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m going to do. I&#8217;ve given notice at Equals and I&#8217;m leaving just before Christmas. And for the first six months of 2020, I&#8217;ll be living off my savings while I try to find some way to make a living from the various business ideas I&#8217;ve been doing almost nothing with for the last thirty years.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to be structured about it. I plan to try six things for a month each. I have an idea what the first two or three things will be but I hope you&#8217;ll forgive me if I don&#8217;t go into any detail right now. I do want to be very open about what I&#8217;m doing while I&#8217;m doing it &#8211; I&#8217;ve set up a new web site at <a href="https://davecross.co.uk/">davecross.co.uk</a> and I&#8217;ll be writing about my projects there. Hey, even if nothing takes off, perhaps there&#8217;s a book in the reports of all my failures.</p>
<p>At the end of June, I&#8217;ll take stock and decide whether it&#8217;s worth continuing the experiment.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m calling my &#8220;2020 Vision&#8221;. Because bad puns are the basis of good marketing &#8211; or something like that.</p>

What, have I suddenly developed super eyesight?<br>Chris: that's what I thought.

So I thought you must have gone mad.<br>Me: so you'd rather ignore everything you know about me and assume that I'd gone mad, rather than entertain the possibility that I might have been talking about the cute little model houses, which only that estate agent has, rather than the photos of houses, which every estate agent has?<br>Chris: I didn't think they were cute.<br>Me: surely it's more plausible that I meant the model houses but that what I think is cute is different from what you think is cute, rather than that I'd suddenly developed super eyesight and also lost my mind?<br>Chris: your position is indefensible<br>Me: my position is defensible.

			<p class="post-info">From: wandsworth witterings</p>
<p dir="ltr">I'm in the grip of several slow-burning obsessions at the moment. Fall Out Boy, for one, I'm sort of crushing on them collectively. What a difference a live gig makes! It's hard to say why as most of the time you had to watch them on the big screens (and why is that different from watching them on YouTube?), but that is the mystery of human presence. Being there, in the same air as people, makes a difference. Why? Maybe they seem more real. Maybe you see everything, not just what the cameraman directs you to see, which helps to fill in the reality of someone.</p><p dir="ltr">Then I've started my new Elena Ferrante book. I wonder if a Lila really existed, or if the author is simply applying herself into two and writing about both halves. I wish I could get the girls to read it: it's such an eye-opening validating piece of work, especially for women. Some woman in the paper was worrying that it wasn&#8217;t really literature. Why? Why not? What is<br>unliterary about it? The fact that it&#8217;s enjoyable? The fact that it acts as<br>though what two young girls in Naples in <u>mid-twentieth</u> century thought or<br>felt is important? I don&#8217;t see how you could find a book more serious intelligent and authentic than these novels are turning out to be.</p><p dir="ltr">On a more trivial note, I've been reading about Kate Moss&#8217; new squeeze in the Telegraph: Nikolai von Bismarck, who from a quick piece of deductive work via Wikipedia, must be the second nephew of Gottfried von Bismarck (the first cousin of Nikolai&#8217;s father Leopold, who was the younger brother of Gottfried&#8217;s father, the<br>Prince von Bismarck). I knew Gottfried from Oxford when we were both in a<br>Ionesco play, The Lesson, being directed by an acquaintance from New College. I didn&#8217;t really know Gottfried, what with him being such a posho, but he seemed perfectly nice. He moved with the Olivia Channon set and died himself a few years ago, essentially from his lifestyle (drugs, gay orgies etc). All rather sad: gilded youth! This was all post the ITV Brideshead craze. Little did I think, as I was living through it, that people would be looking back at the eighties in a haze of nostalgia.</p><p dir="ltr">At lunch I went out and bought some Vichy Aqualia Thermal Serum because it<br>was on a Guardian list of best skincare products and I&#8217;m running out of<br>face cream. I don&#8217;t even know how to use it! It was &#163;5 off. I wonder if it<br>will have any detectible effect on my skin, that wouldn&#8217;t be just as well<br>achieved with a &#163;5 pot of generic moisturiser. Anyway, when I went to pay,<br>instead of the self-service checkout asking whether I wanted to buy a bag,<br>there simply were no bags. There was only a little Boots man wandering<br>around with a handful of bags. I told him I wanted to buy one, but I had no<br>change. He shoved a little paper bag into my hand and whispered, &#8220;Go, go,<br>run away!&#8221; which I promptly did. Hilarious.</p>

			<p class="post-info">From: vendazero</p>
Went for a walk earlier because like Old Mother Hubbard my cupboard was bare .Didnt have a lot of cash so first stop was the fruit/veg market as they were packing up looked through a few boxes and ended up with about 40 apples.a pineapple,6 nice carrots,garlic and all for the bargain price of £0.00.Next stop a Health food place that every night puts out a few bags of goodies just reaching the sell by date ,its all perfectly good food.the haul was 200g of Cornish Camembert,125g of goats cheese,18 Glenilen Farm probiotic yoghurts 160g jars I kept 6 and redistributed the others to homeless people on my journey home.I called at Sainsburys and was able to splash out on Normandy butter ,a sunflower+honey bloomer loaf,Youngs fish ,a £4 ham and pineapple pizza so its good eating today.After washing/scrubbing the free fruit/veg it was juiced and produced 4 pints of juice better and fresher than the stuff bought in the shops.It still amazes and pisses me off the amount of good food throw away and destined for landfills while so many people are havuing a hard time and starving.Just grateful Im not one of them.

			<p class="post-info">From: vendazero</p>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Its my opinion that selling Big Issues is a honest honarable way to make a living.Ive been doing it on and off from the very begining, sure Im critical of the way its run but the benefits far outweigh the negative aspects.So the wages are not the best in the world but your rewards come in the form of the great orduinary people that you meet.Im not the sort that pushes it in peoples faces,I like to think that people who buy from me do so because they want to not because Ive put pressure on them or made them feel guilty in any way.In the past year Ive had a professional fundraising org headhunting me,telling me I could make 4 times as much for less effort.Truth is if I was to shake a bucket claiming the money was for starving third world children well thats where it would have to go,not in my pocket.Im no angel and while selling Big Issues if anyone asks I tell them the money is for me and if asked I tell them my housing status.Like I say Im honest like all the other venders, we dont make a living from other peoples misery - only our own.My advice before parting with money to a charity think about how much reaches those that need it.

			<p class="post-info">From: vendazero</p>
My apologies for ranting about time spent in the&nbsp; hostel system but in my opinion it was 6yrs of my life wasted.6 years where I had to have a keywork session with a moron every week and awnser the same questions over and over again.FFS how long does it take to asses someone and see if they are suitable for housing.Im of the opinion its a deliberate conspiracy to prove to society how essential they are in the rehabilitation of poor unfortunates like myself.Only thing is Ive never thought of&nbsp; myself as unfortunate no matter what apart from the times I had to sit and listen to all their fucking crap.I put up with it because I wanted a permanent place of my own without them having acsess to my room or supported housing unit so the nosey fuckers could snoop while I was out.I often used toleave little notes for them to find but only offensive ones.They couldnt say anything about this as they shouldn have been snooping .Its a fact if I had a key to their houses and did to them what they do to their residents I would probably be branded a pervert and locked up for a long time.In a nutshell hostels dont work as most residents end up back on the streets or are kicked out for raising hell about their draconian rules.

&nbsp; So it been established that rough sleepers have a pretty rough time,one night a outreach worker eventually finds them hidden in some out of the way place,they say I can get you a hostel place,meet me tomorrow.Let me tell you it feels like finding the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.So you meet you go through all the procedures you think peace,safety ,escape from alcholuism ,petty crime,drug addiction&nbsp; and all its related baggage,you feel exstatic but that soon wears off when you are in your cell like room ,it begins to dawn on you that what you are holding in your arms like a new born baby is not as you envisaged a pot of gold but in reality its a bucket of shit.You are so run down tired you dont care anymore so you sleep.You awake to the sound of footsteps in the coridor,keys getting pushed intolocks door slamming obcenities being shouted,youre half asleep thinking shit slop out already,you rush to get dressed looking for the bucket there is none.The door opens you have one leg in your trousers a voice booms room check ,it then dawns on you again you are not in the Holiday Inn ,but a hostel ,you dont yet know youve been sentenced to 6yrs.

			<p class="post-info">From: alice's dark place</p>
I'm just going to come right out and say it. &nbsp;I am not a huge fan of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoticon">emoticons</a>. &nbsp;I do not use a happy face to indicate happiness, or a sad face to indicate sadness. &nbsp;I don't even use LOL when texting or IMing, as I prefer a simple "ha!" to get the idea of laughter accross.<br /><br />However, I will acknowledge that I am in the minority. &nbsp;If there was a battle, I lost. &nbsp;Emoticons have won, and I accept their place in the world. &nbsp;I will even admit that they can make the tone of an email or text or whatever clear if the words themselves don't convey the proper meaning. &nbsp;I don't use them myself, but if someone sends me a frowny face or a confused face, I understand their meaning and move on with my life.<br /><br />Except!<br /><br />The winky face. &nbsp;If there is one emoticon I cannot stand, it is the winky face. &nbsp;You know the one I mean:<br /><br />;)<br /><br />The intended meaning, as far as I'm aware, is to convey cheekiness or sassiness. &nbsp;And it drives me up the freaking wall. &nbsp;Because here is the thing. &nbsp;In real life, people smile at each other, or frown, or have big smiles, or stick out their tongues (which, ugh), or look surprised. &nbsp;All of which have a corresponding emoticon to convey these expressions.<br /><br />Do you know what people don't do? &nbsp;Wink at each other. &nbsp;Constantly wink at each other. &nbsp;And if they do, they should stop, because I'm sure they'll just develop a twitch of some kind.<br /><br />There only two contexts I can think of where winking is appropriate in real life. <br /><br />One: &nbsp;If you are playing a joke on someone and want to let someone they are with in on the joke subtly. &nbsp;A wink at that person while continuing the joking will get that message across, and then hopefully they'll get in on the joke and you'll all have some fun times.<br /><br />Two: &nbsp;A pickup wink, done in jest. &nbsp;Possibly accompanied by finger guns. &nbsp;This works in almost any circumstance in life, and is generally delightful.<br /><br />That's it! &nbsp;Those are the only two situations in which you should be winking! &nbsp;Or maybe if you're trying to get a contact back in place. &nbsp;But blinking would also accomplish this, so let's forget that one.<br /><br />Two!<br /><br />So, when I see people (and god help me, so many people do this) use the winky face after a comment they mean to be funny, all I can think is STOP STOP STOP! &nbsp;If you need to use an emoticon (and I really must stress that no one <i>needs </i>to use an emoticon) in that case, will the smiley face not do? &nbsp;What is wrong with the good old smiley face? &nbsp;Are you too good for the smiley face??<br /><br />Your cheekiness comes across as far less cheeky if you have to tell me you're being cheeky! &nbsp;(Also, the work cheeky looks funny when you write it too many times.

			<p class="post-info">From: balham bugle</p>
<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>A person with a little bit of information is usually a danger to themselves and possibly society.  This is particularly the case at a time when <b>something must be done</b>.<br/><br/>A good example of this is the present scandal on MPs' expenses (does it have an official name yet - "Duck-gate").  A number of people have jumped on some analysis by <a href='http://markreckons.blogspot.com/'>Mark Reckons</a>, a LibDem blogger, that seems to indicate there is a <a href='http://markreckons.blogspot.com/2009/05/mps-expenses-and-safe-seats-correlation.html'>positive correlation between the size of an MP's electoral majority and the chances that they will abuse the expenses system</a>.  In essence, the more safe an MP feels, the more likely they are to be a crook.<br/><br/>This apparent correlation has led Mark and a number of other people (such as <a href='http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2009/may/18/mps-expenses-constitution-electoral-reform'>Polly Toynbee </a>and <a href='http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2009/may/18/mps-expenses-constitution-electoral-reform'>Ben Bradshaw</a>) to suggest that we move away from the <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_pass_the_post'>First-Pass-The-Post </a>election system.  Their reasoning is that a <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional_representation'>PR</a> election system would lead to lower majorities for MPs', and according to this correlation, more honest MPs.<br/><br/>Now, the first problem with this is that (I think) the analysis doesn't stand up to scrunity (details of my concerns are <a href='http://markreckons.blogspot.com/2009/05/mps-expenses-and-safe-seats-correlation.html?showComment=1242939618750#c485085803594386952'>here</a>).  Mark has been careful to caveat his statistical conclusions, though I don't think his caveats go far enough.  The caveats, of course, have been ignored by everyone else.<br/><br/>Secondly, even if there is a correlation, it does not mean there is any real or useful link between majorities and honest MPs.  A classic example is the correlation that areas with high level of policing having a high level of crime, leading to the policy conclusion that policing should be reduced as it causes crime.<br/><br/>And finally, what no-one seems to have tried to show is how PR will help, even if the correlation holds.  Though there may be many reasons for PR, tackling MPs expense dodgies seems the flimsest.  Consider:<br/><ul><li>While PR will change the majorities of some MPs, it needn't necessarily lead to the fall in the majorities overall.  You could have some MPs, which after first and second votes, have a larger majority.</li></ul><ul><li>Some forms of PR can lead to more corruption.  For instance, voters have little ability of getting rid of a hated MP in some forms of close list systems, where that MP heads the list.</li></ul><ul><li>It would seem from the evidence of the unseating of <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Hamilton_%28politician%29'>Neil Hamilton</a> in the 1997 election, and the current mass sacking of tarnished MPs, that the current system can act to get rid of sleazy MPs when the voters have the facts.</li></ul>So please, before advocating constitutional reform, can we stop and think for one moment.<br/></div>

<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'><a href='http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8002085.stm'>What I can't get is why Gordon says sorry so badly.</a> The secret of political apologies to so say sorry quickly and completely, to close the story down (you may also want to say sorry because you mean it, that works too). Brown's apologies are slow and grudging.<br/><br/>Gordon has waited five days before apologizing about Smeargate.  By waiting and then saying sorry, he's guaranteed further damaging coverage of the story as the morning paper report his apology and analysis it. If he had said sorry straight away when McBride had resigned, the story would have been over already (assuming there's no further emails).<br/><br/>Also, his apology is so mealy mouthed.<br/><blockquote>I take full responsibility for what happened. That's why the person who was responsible went immediately.<br/></blockquote>If you take full responsibility, you take full responsibility. You can't say I take full responsibility, but in the same breath say I'm not the responsible person. And I'm sure that Gordon is "sorry for what happened", but is sorry that people in his office considered smearing people.<br/><br/><div class='zemanta-pixie'><img src='http://img.zemanta.com/pixy.gif?x-id=39618892-3a48-8a1e-8630-ba710abd75a1' class='zemanta-pixie-img'/></div></div>

			<p class="post-info">From: balham bugle</p>
<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>The Government has just sprung another leak.  As reported by <a href='http://iaindale.blogspot.com/2008/12/leaked-email-from-harman-no-tories-or.html'>Iain Dale</a>, an email has just been leaked showing that Harriet Harman is to have a meeting with the Speaker's Office and the Serjeant at Arms to discuss the Speakers statement to MPs on Wednesday about allowing Police to search Damian Green's Parliamentary Office.  Other invitees to Harman's meeting include Gus O'Donnell, Jacqui Smith and Jack Straw.<br /><br />However, apart from the irony of another leak (and the desperation of Labour's news management), the best bit about this story is Harman's office attempt to wriggle out.  According to the <a href='http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7759629.stm'>BBC</a>, her spoken has said:<br /><br /><blockquote>"The purpose of the meeting is to discuss the parliamentary business and handling of issues that arise from the fact that the speaker's statement and the Queen's Speech will be happening on the same day."<br /></blockquote><br /><br />Yes, if you are going to have a meeting about Parliamentary procedure,<br />you invite the Head of the Civil Service, the Justice Secretary and the<br />Home Secretary (as well as the Labour Chief Whip) at less than 24 hours<br />notice; they are busy people, who enjoy nothing more than talking about<br />seating arrangements.</div>

			<h2><a href="http://balhambugle.blogspot.com/2008/11/putting-destruction-in-context.html">Putting destruction in context</a></h2>
			<p class="post-info">From: balham bugle</p>
<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>The third headline on the BBC news website was "<a href='http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/7756241.stm'>Amazon deforestation accelerates</a>".  The article, in doom laden tones, usually consider appropriate by the BBC for environmental stories, states that:<br/><blockquote>The destruction of the Amazon rainforest in Brazil has accelerated for the first time in four years, Brazilian officials say. Satellite images show 11,968 sq km of land was cleared in the year to July, nearly 4% higher than the year before...<br/><br/>In recent years the Brazilian government has been able to celebrate three successive falls in deforestation. But the latest estimate from the National Institute for Space Research, known as INPE, shows that this trend has come to a halt. <br/></blockquote>Now, at a time that the world seems to be falling apart, with the terror attacks in Mumbai, protests in Thailand, the end of Western capitalism, and the assault by the Met police on Parliamentary sovereignty, you would think the ordering of BBC stories is strange. But the biggest sin, is the poverty of the story.<br/><br/>The lesser error is the suggestion that one year data can signal an end of a trend. To be honest, I wouldn't be sure that three years of downward data shows there is a downward trend; but there there is no way to tell whether this year's rise was a new trend or a blip.<br/><br/>But the howler is saying the 12,000 sq km were destroyed (as opposed to trees just being cut down) without any context.  How big is 12,000 sq km?<br/><br/>Using what seems to have been the international benchmark of choice when discussion Amazon destruction, 12,000 sq km is around half of Wales; that seems big.  A more appropriate comparison is that 12,000 sq km is but 0.2 per cent of the total <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_rain_forest'>rainforest</a> area of 5,500,000 sq km.  Or put it another way, this rate of loss would have to continue for 50 years for the present rainforest to fall by 10 per cent; hardly disastrous.<br/><br/><b><em>So the bottom line of the story is there is no evidence that the slowdown of a already very slow fall in the Amazon rainforest has stopped.  A good news story.</em></b> <br/></div>
